##### Subject

Comments on S7-27-15: Strengthening American Leadership in Securities Industries

##### Body

Hi,

The recent [executive order promoting innovations](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/strengthening-american-leadership-in-digital-financial-technology/) asked our government to "identify all regulations, guidance documents, orders, or other items that affect the digital asset sector." Accordingly, we request a review of certain ownership exemptions under UCC Article 8 and transfer agent regulations in general. Transfer agents are the most direct means investors have for transacting in the market for stocks. Our National competitiveness in capital markets may depend on the regulations governing digital-asset providers of these services given a TAD.

We hope the new Crypto Task Force will consider rules directly protecting investor portfolios in the case of clearing agency insolvencies. Hopefully, an updated set of transfer agent governance will spur an innovative "market structure, oversight, consumer protection, and risk management" that empowers the Commission to protect an overlooked industry sector of increasing importance after the market events of four years ago, when several brokerages popular with retail elected to change access to certain securities to position close only without warning.

FOIA Services,

Please see request in note 8XYZ9 (DTC submit) and 24329OCC (reminder on 24-01211-E).


In good faith,
John Wooten
Member, WhyDRS

Dear Secretary,

When I was a boy in high school, I began researching the stock market. At the time, I was working a minimum-wage job at Subway every spare weeknight or weekend double. I'd walk about half an hour to and from the store in the latter case when my mom was caught up at work. In the fleeting moments I had between classes and later athletics, I turned all my spare attention to our great investing industry because it promised a way out of the daily servitude.

^ 15 leaves broker insolvency out of control scope

In just one brief lifetime, we've seen our great nation's market system attract and expand to households from all ends of society. While only the affluent and wealthy might have had access to the securities of a distant physical past, today's most meager investors can trade on a fair playing ground with the same opportunities for growth.[^rh-fractional-filings]

Or at least, it's supposed to be a fair equivalency. Because I was only 16 after months of researching the market, brokers wouldn't extend an account under my name. It was these early trades outside my own control that shaped my underlying passion for efficient securities markets, and my resolve that an investor's portfolio shouldn't be outside of their control. Indeed, I expect quite reasonably that a stock be registered and owned outright in my name when I pay good money to its seller. Do you agree that one's portfolio should be their own property?

Unfortunately, this is not the case in today's market functions, no matter your age. Indeed, it hasn't been the case since the unstructured monopolization of the clearing and settlement market many decades ago, despite both the Commission's and Congress' best efforts.[^mon] For decades this reality has narrowly averted public catastrophe.[^lehman] But we can no longerignotr yhr glaring accounting innacuranceis creating systemic idiosyncratic risks.[^other-3-ex]

Have we forgotten the significant work performed by Commissioner Aguilar, efforts which seem radically undermined by the settlement failures highlighted?[^ostk-augi] At least a dozen States have introduced legislation undermining the conceit and constructions DTCC's agents introduced into the 1994 Uniform Commercial Code.[^DTCcs] Quite soon, a select few States intend to reconstitute the right of investors to their own portfolios as a due property law. When this happens, I am extremely concerned with the solvency of Cede & Co. should any number of institutional custodians relocate to such jurisdictions to reap the enhanced protections promised by our shared ideologies.

I want direct quotes here focused by and large on the agent part. _See also_ The legislative reform should stay in the main argument. https://fmlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Issue-3-Background-paper-on-Article-8-of-the-Uniform-Commercial-Code.pdf#page=8

Given cryptosystems and decentralized exchanges allow these transactions without the possibility of FTDs, I asked Commissioner Aguilar alongside their venture-fund company about their interpretation of if they "would or would not consider a DEX to be an ATS" in a written communication and video meeting two years ago. If staff agree with the supportive remarks in these discussions and pro-digital-assets rhetoric espoused by our present governmental leadership, then might we need an oversight system for uncovered peer-to-peer distributed transaction messaging systems?

## Organizational Association

I am writing to you on behalf of WhyDRS, a decentralized unincorporated nonprofit association ("DUNA") of thousands of individual investors. We are both the first American DUNA and a recently-approved IRS public 501(c)(3) charitable organization.[^start-duna] We sincerely appreciate staff's diligent efforts over the past few years of our collective outreach.[^ncs] It is a beautiful and appreciated reality that our incredible American institution provides a publicly accessible way to submit issues for public comment, and assurance that those submissions will not only be displayed publicly in kind but that they will be reviewed and considered by bright financial minds.

Our Association stemmed largely from the unprecedented shutdown of market operations on 28 Jan 2021.[^cong] I believe in the capacities of our regulatory system to innovate and promote the three core tenets of the Commission's mission. However, four years later, our great financial system still faces a well-known sweltering threat able to subvert even the most prudent rules set by this great Commission.

I will defer from citing the Commission's public censures thereof in deference to the larger structural challenges more pressing given the present heights of our market. A central counterparty is only a piece of a larger centralized financial system, a superstructure which I believe enables the complexity, opacity, and obfuscations so pressing to masses of investors without Bloomberg Terminals. Departing Commissioner Gensler was pushed on this point in an interview a year after the peak of community interest and price action in a select few securities.[^new-crowdsourcing] Might our online efforts "outside of the bureaucracy" help define a new trading and settlement regime rooted in quality capital formation, fair and efficient markets, and protecting our own orderly activity?

This has been my oversight vision ever since I started working on the transfer agent depository ("TAD") system previously communicated and widely available via free software code online.[^about-bt] As shown by the upward trend of staff in the last few decades,[^staff-nums] regulating our vast markets for capital is an exceedingly complex job. This function will only get more difficult as larger swaths of the population become investors given the need to build real savings and retirements through financial assets. Additionally, I question our present legal system's ability to protect international investors entrusting their capital into American enterprises.[^global-protections]

Hopefully, we can overcome these challenges together over the years with a proactive governance scheme embodying the Commission's public objectives. Might now be the time to take action on the years of work built by industry innovators since the advent of widespread blockchain technologies? Namely, so much of my past work entailed codifying present securities distribution and holding laws into a decentralized protocol. This system builds on thousands and thousands of hours of work made freely available through blockchain networks. Given the auspice of our present Administration to promote these developments, perhaps this is the time to prepare ourselves with a backup market system rooted in efficiency, transparency, and honesty.


[^staff-nums]: _See, e.g.,_ criticism from an organization we have generally found pause with describing the relatively linear growth of the Commission over the past two decades, _available at_ https://www.congress.gov/118/meeting/house/116994/witnesses/HHRG-118-BA16-Wstate-BurtonD-20240320.pdf#page=3. The document later claims that "the term SRO is now a misnomer" because such organizations "have more personnel conducting regulatory functions than the SEC and combined budgets roughly comparable to the SEC." As the Commission knows and this report notes, Congress has practically no oversight of these regulators, private agents who've been afforded potentially unconstitutional power governing while "largely unaccountable to the industry or to the public." I affirmed these concurrent sentiments directly with our community last year given developments in a case teed up for the Supreme Court challenging the authority decreed to "the most important regulator of financial services providers," _available at_ https://wooten.link/alpine. Surely, staff are familiar with these proceedings, and I provide abbreviated citations for public education and specificity only. My stylized link abbreviations are a temporary measure until we configure certain organizational open-source document repositories, used in place of unreliably hosted servers or excessively lengthy web addresses.

[^about-bt]: _See_ _infra_ notes {{^repos}} and {{^FOSS}}. I will defer from extended discussion into this work throughout this letter given the larger overarching items mentioned. Notwithstanding, I want to clarify the distinction between this writing and past work at BlockTrans Syndicate ("the Syndicate"). There is no distinction. I plan to continue drafting comments as a participant in both of these legal organizations. It can be generally construed that my remarks henceforth represent my own individual perspective unless I make use of the "we" pronoun, by which I mean to convey a policy or interpretation choice of the representative group submitting comments on a good-faith basis.

[^start-duna]: _See_ community conversation on the new DUNA filing process and years of past self-organized work, _available at_ https://lnns.co/0PuFl1TZzWe. <!-- a quote ere would be nice -->

[^new-crowdsourcing]: _See_ clip from Apple TV programming, _available at_ https://youtu.be/0C0Sj6Us19I. This discussion led to extensive dialogue across our community because we care very deeply about the protections availed by our democracy to investors, including a grassroots fundraising drive to send the Commission coffee mugs and beans. _See also generally_ research paper from Neal Newman, J.D., identifying how central intermediaries unilaterally disabled market access in order to serve their business interests over trading continuity, _inter alia_, _available at_ https://ssrn.com/abstract=4459285. _Compare_ investors' decentralized innovative heartfelt action towards staff with "a conscious decision to leave retail investors vulnerable" given a discretionary choice in § V.B to place short-term business interests first.

[^cong]: _See_ two Congressional hearings and a staff report study with wide-standing consequences, _available at_ https://www.c-span.org/program/house-committee/gamestop-hearing-part-1/588548, https://www.c-span.org/program/house-committee/gamestop-hearing-part-2/589320, and https://www.sec.gov/files/staff-report-equity-options-market-structure-conditions-early-2021.pdf; respectively. While few commentators have yet associated transfer agent regulations with these historic market events, I find the items inexplicably intertwined. NSCC and its participants could only halt trading given the lack of a functional transfer-agent self-custody transaction system operating outside the National Market System as presently established around the central intermediaries so key in revolutionizing clearing and settlement fifty years ago. Has Congress meaningfully contemplated the structure of our markets after the immense consolidation of post-trade processing into a single holding company made immensely powerful by its constituent self-regulatory organizations ("SROs")?

[^ncs]: Let's carefully cite a range from the NSCC petition to OCC withdrawal to EDGAR modernization to things from the ~~other side of the _hall_~~ democratic PoV (?) with deference to scrutinizing TAR at n/16 (_see Id_). <!-- TODO -->

[^global-protections]: _See, e.g.,_ _Morrison v. National Australia Bank_, a Supreme Court case finding 10b-5 anti-fraud protections do not apply to international losses, _available at_ https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/149289/morrison-v-national-australia-bank-ltd. _See also_ a presumption against extraterritorial investor protections in _City of Pontiac Policemen's & Firemen's Retirement System v. UBS AG_ (2d Cir.), _available at_ https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/8441742/city-of-pontiac-policemens-firemens-retirement-system-v-ubs-ag. I was particularly concerned over the dismissal of the Oregon Public Employees Board's claims solely because they acquired securities in a transaction outside of America, a delineation which is impossible to make in a more decentralized peer-to-peer environment. Given the centrality of exchange to secondary markets, I do not find it acceptable that some investors trade on a different playing field than others solely because of their geographical venue.

### Educating

Wall Street stunned our community when they unilaterally seized our ability to acquire a public security subject to no restrictions by the Commission. From this shock, our driving **and unwavering** objective centered around understanding the "Rube Goldberg" machine Congress expects staff to effectively oversee on a daily basis. The further many community members dove into market structure, the clearer it became that its reliance on a single fallible party exposes all investors to significant risk.

Since this awakening, we've made every effort to share and collectively inform the public about the material difference in ownership rights under direct individual securities registration, as compared to street-name registration.[^street-name] Historically, the Commission specifically responded when "many firms were thinly capitalized" under an SRO structure that was "unprepared" with outdated systems that "were essentially the same as those utilized" a decade prior.[^street-name-2] We hope that ongoing rulemaking will continue weighing the present risks of securities entitlements held through a central clearing counterparty and subsequent centralized depository nominee, an overarching market structure common across nations and commonly entangled with a net settlement system (the "Custodial Structure").[^ccp-regime]

As the Commission knows, this led to one nominee owning virtually all American securities once DTC organized its nominee Cede & Co. over five decades ago.[^cede-questions] Namely, the concentration of nearly all investment assets into a _partnership trust_ presents unworkable conflicts of interest in the expansion of collateral lending facilities, be they direct or implicated by operational policies.

This point will become more readily apparent as further evidence documents in this comment. One key public article detailing the centrality of this fact exists on our website: *"The DTC/Ceding Ownership – Choice without a Choice."* As the Commission knows, our great American capitalist system relies on voluntary exchange of goods and services. Issuers cannot avail themselves of this basic benefit of free markets because there exists no competitor to DTCC. In fact, such a proposition has been coercively deemed unactionable by some of our nation's leading "Too Big to Fail" banks. We sincerely appreciate staff highlighting these facts in an exceptionally revealing image from the concept release at 45:

![im](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddf2995c-79a6-4af9-b566-c153c138ad8d)

Over the years, we've come to greatly appreciate staff's perpetual diligent efforts to explain these structural nuances to the investing public. I, for one, would have had to pay many hundreds of thousands of dollars in either collegiate expenses or legal fees to comprehend information made freely available through Commission rulemaking, interpretive actions, and public statements. For these grand efforts by your many teams, I sincerely appreciate the immense decentralized power of securities regulation through direct acting agents. Might the present system of increasingly singular execution chokepoints for stock trading directly limit our democracy's ability to govern intermediaries? Namely, can we truly oversee an institution so opaque yet irreplaceable that the select few at its helm decree credit policy so central to market operations?


[^street-name]: While "Wall Street name" is a relatively well-known concept today, the concept release first introduces the term in note 45 related to the cited "Unsafe Practices Study" for Congress, _available at_ https://www.sechistorical.org/collection/papers/1970/1971_1201_SECUnsafe_01.pdf. At 29 therein, staff authors contemplate the failure of businesses "under a capitalistic system" before the widespread development of brokerage capital requirements.

[^street-name-2]: _Id._ On the very next page of this document, staff write that "Treasury funds which are available in the event they are needed to accomplish the goals of SIPC are not an inexhaustible amount" and ultimately originate from taxpayer dollars. Does the Commission plan to exhaust any required SIPC funds in the event of a clearing agency failure, especially given their particularly thin capitalization as compared to the assets they hold?

[^ccp-regime]: _See also_ reference to this market structure as a "Custodial Structure" by various world government regulators such as the European Securities and Markets Authority, a group that used the term in at least three final technical reports from 2013 to 2017 and ultimately codified it into an adopted regulation amendment with nearly three dozen mentions of the regime, _available at_ https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52017PC0331&qid=1738728760923. _Compare_ to further academic references using the term by Dr. jur. Yuxi Li, who expresses grave concerns over "conflicts of interests in the corporation" in 2019, _available at_ https://ediss.sub.uni-hamburg.de/bitstream/ediss/8178/1/Dissertation.pdf#page=114. Even Dr. Steven McNamara, J.D., uses the term in a 2014 paper defending the concentration of risk into a single entity amidst a growing derivatives complex, _available at_ http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/ndjlepp/vol28/iss1/6.

### Burgeoning Views

In the last ten years, certain blockchain technologies have emerged through the work of no central solicitor. Indeed, communities themselves both spawn up around the promise of these innovations and actively participate in building their future successful implementations. This work removes the need for centralized trust and explicitly obviates the function of DTCC and its subsidiaries. In a book profiling the DTCC at the brink of the Great Recession, the corporation's founding CEO wrote:[^dentzer]

> I thought throughout these years that as much as I despised monopolies, a DTC monopoly would be benign. Why? After all, monopolies tend to raise fees to customers unduly, let products or services slide in quality and ignore developing services for small customers... All of these developments, along with user desires that DTCC expand its capabilities in order to reduce financial firms' costs and risks, produced a DTCC that is now larger and more complex than the sum of its former parts at the time of their consolidation.
>
> &mdash; William T. Dentzer, Jr.

More and more, today's investors do not trust in either the DTC or its largest members' solvencies, as will be shown in coming evidence. Should the Custodial Structure face any shortcomings in operational liquidity, Cede faces not only the very real prospect of failing, but also a pre-existing central plan for "bankruptcy replacement" by another surviving Custodial Structure.[^tn-hearing-exp] Such a course of action would immiserate hundreds of millions of custodial investment accounts.

To prevent this blatant theft, there appears to be no alternative course of action than the migration of securities holdings onto a blockchain and, specifically, the Stellar network.[^xlm-minimal-info] I would like to submit this point to the Commission today but make no further technical elaborations in this letter. In coming to this conclusion, I have extensively contemplated alternatives since my foray into Web3 research and development eight years ago. Four years ago, I began building an open-source alternative to the Custodial Structure on this blockchain. This system was materially ready for public deployment upon the submission of my first letter to the Commission two years ago, albeit canonically.

Some of our most concentrated financial institutions will attack this proposed free transaction scheme. They probably have a fiduciary duty to do so, which is fine. Certain DTC employees stopped speaking to me long ago. Indeed, even my laundry machine is older than the proposed blockchain network. I've sunk my life into discovering the most efficient system, and I plan to explain the logic of this choice in another letter.


[^dentzer]: _See_ _The Depository Trust Company: DTC's Formative Years and Creation of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC)_ from YBK Publishers. in discussing new laws to allow Cede ownership, "DTC enlisted regulatory agencies, legal bodies, industry associations, and others to make these changes, with growing success in the late 1970s."

[^xlm-minimal-info]: Stellar is one of the few platforms that accounts for liquidity at scale without a centralized party (as associated with traditional Alternative Trading Systems). We no longer require these brokerage middlemen to grease the wheels of markets with regard to the trading of securities held in the Direct Registration System. Staff can hear more about how the blockchain network takes a crowdsourced approach to liquidity in our community discussion of its features, _available at_ https://lnns.co/WJoHIMAXTV4. The SDEX gives all users equal access to a global decentralized order book for any pair of assets on the network. Staff can also investigate a more comprehensive analysis of this system's implications on market structure and general societal improvements, _available at_ https://wooten.link/thesis. Since its genesis in 2014, the SDEX has processed over 4.6 billion trades worth 27 billion U.S. dollars.

### Collective Solution

Since the start of our research and development into the Custodial Structure, all local efforts came from volunteers. Individual investors en masse contributed selflessly their insights and revelations, whether it was a few hours parsing legalese showcasing abundant naked shorting[^california] or many days absorbing years of market research.[^intinet-50] This decentralized collaboration lead to our present DUNA structure whereby all communications take place in the open and public light of transparency, a trait direly needed in today's markets. 

This aligns directly with the blockchain solutions staff contemplate as either a replacement to the Custodial Structure or implementation of a TAD system across private and public markets.[^intro-blockchain] The founding ethos of these decentralized digital ledgering networks perpetually stemmed around "allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party."[^nak-btc] However, the entire Custodial Structure revolves around trusted third parties, some so systemically-important that banking regulators deem them too big to fail.

To sum, we are building on top of well-defined cryptographic norms of both collaboration and transactional custody, defining a system that brings everyone into the same market playing field. This work introduces a sorely-needed working alternative to the linchpin single custodian entrusted with practically all American securities, as more and more investors demand direct custody of their investments. I will not elaborate extensively on this technology yet, as I find its principles to be our greater concern giving the looming safety holes in the Custodial Structure.


[^california]: _See, e.g.,_ Overstock case documents released by the _Economist_ among a plethora of evidence detailing brokers' abuse of central clearing and settlement systems, _available at_ https://wooten.link/economist-suit. Our fun learning how these FTDs destroy markets helps fuel a growing passion for an effective and decentralized market system.

[^intinet-50]: _See, e.g.,_ analysis of largest market counterparty failures during the buy-button even four short years ago, _available at_  https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1hxllrt/a_brief_history_of_gamestop_from_meme_to_moass. We all independently revolt against Wall Street's immense central control through our understandings of and actions reforming the national market system.

## Systemic Banking Idiosyncrasies

Our derviatices, bandking ,ad nfinancail system seem tightly intertwined with the Custodial Structure. Given my concerns over the stability of this sytem, justidfied by rulemaking last year,[^wind-down-rule] I woiuld like to disucss the downstream implications of an overreliance on a select few protocols. These can be open standards or porporietary corporate operations , ultimately leading to a concentration of risk for all investors given any operational breakdowns.

Today's financial systems evolved by neccesity from an antequated paeprwork-based system. As an anectdotal matter of exmaple, my partner recently cashed in a few thousands follars' worth of Series EE bonds in certificate form. Given our proximity to depist-taking instutions open for our business outside of her busy working schedule, we drove over an hour to a nearby bank. We would need to make a siilar tripto obtain a legacy medallion signature garuntee, as I udertand the services of this particualr banking business.

Once we arrived, it took at least three hours to deposit all of the bonds despite the fact that nobody else was in front of us in the teller line. First, m y partner manually signed ech of the paper slips representing a bbond. Secondly, she gave the teller her Social Security number and address, both of which were on file with the instuttino. Then, we stood for hours while the gracous teller mannually keyed in data about each of the individual bonds. Repeatedly during the exchange, they told us that a single keystroke error would invalidate the entire manual entry process, requiring slow and methodical data entry while a line amassed in the lobby for other tellers unable to help due to the nature of the computer security systemn.

Two months after this interation, my partner recieved a letter on Janurary 6, stating a savings bond "was redeemed for an incorrect amount." The actual amount was redeemed was 40% less than originalyl credited, resulting in a deduction which overdrafter her account as $100 previously withdrawn turned into $59.76. Does the Commission bleive our financial system should rely on processes so routinely porone to human error? 
The message was signed by the name "SSS" from the bank's "Centralized Operations."

### Equivalnet Outstanding Mishandling

Many in our community are concerned about the manual invovlement of so many middlemen in secruturies tradin gan d settlement.[^ex-intro-mm] As a case of example, certain industry particpants claim that the industry has moved on from paper-wrok-based trading to muc h more automated syste,s.[^schackin-testimony]

_Id._ Concerningly, the OCC says that margin failure testing is both "a highly manual process" and "would require significant investment of time and resources" in their comment on the rule, _available at_ https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-10-23/s71023-225499-472722.pdf#page=10. The latter statement, as I read it, implies that major systemic and interlateral members of the Custodial Structure do not presently simulate advanced recovery scenarios for member failures. I find this gravely concerning given the quick markdown of Robinhood's gross exposure and margining markdown four short years ago. As the Commission knows, the broker's $3.7 billion obligation to the Custodial Structure placed the intermediary at risk for insolvency given their $700 million in collateralizable assets.[^staff-gme-study] Accordingly, such Regime members, without public review or comment, elected to decrease obligations by $2 billion, an amount of money available by means of emergency Wall Street fundraising, quite possibly placing the stability of the entire financial system at stake. Should we trust our most meaningful periods of market volatility such as Trade 385 in the hands of systems subject to fat-fingering or human-processing errors?

"Our markets have evolved dramatically [in 30 yr]. Before this transformation, the average person could easily understand how they functioned. Trading mostly was manual, slow, and inefficient... for end users."

Growing up, I was not the kind of child to play sports or explore the outdoors willingly. I recall one year in middle school where my Mom would lock me outside the house for half an hour a day. She got quite flustered when I sat in the garage working on trivial phone apps. It was that tendency to find electronic solitude each day that lead me into our great market system as an individual investor. But despite great advancements in computer technology, many legacy financial functions still rely on faulty physical verification protocols.

While these range in severity from DTC offering confirmation meetings and calls to medallion stamps, the core challenge remains anchored in the legacy regime's centralization. With Cede as the nexus of all market activity, investors often-unwillingly but coercively need to vest power and control to Wall Street's whimsical hypothecation facilities, which I will not extensively explore in this letter.

This tendency towards efficient digital systems held top-of-mind for me when I waited at least thirty minutes in a courthouse line last November. I was frustrated by the heinous events just north of Pittsburgh last year, and I hoped that my vote of confidence in our President could help our cross-institutional protocols serve American investors, not Wall Street elites. Might we follow in the current Administration's objective "to maintain self-custody of digital assets" which are ou familiar securities themselves?[^DA-EO] --just after reading through this, thinking it may be handy to add a small disclaimer to the already effective section at the top trying to draw the line between views which represent the collective and those which are personal. Something that shouldn't need to be said but perhaps still could be considering how new the concept of a DUNA is--


In accordance with this Executive interest in sectors related to support "stability of the financial system, individual privacy, and the sovereignty of the United States," I find it meaningful to consider the Congressional implications[^cede-fail] of a shift towards decentralization.



The DTCC itself admits that the Custodial Structure itself "cannot fuaruntee that their orderly wind-down will not cause contagion within the financial syusten or that the stability of the U.S. financial system will not be impacted."[^dtc-smac-1]

The policy change addresses how the Custodial Structure "can pose systemic risk to the financial system" given participants "concentrate risk in the clearing agency." Staff at 119 go so far as to say that "contagion events that could pose a systemic danger to the U.S. financial system." I appreciate the Commission's active role in attempting to mitigate these unnecessary risks, which DTCC itself claims are impossible to expunge at note 441.

## Clear Unsolved Challenges

Despite best offers from staff throughout an administration of intense individual investor advocacy, many of our structural market problems remain. We applaud the Commission for their exemplary efforts in XYZ_REG_NMS_tick_yya and implementing the universal proxy.[^pers]

These well-intentioned policies chip away piecemeal at the larger challenges of a securities industry operated on the basis of a single opaque, concentrated, and overbearing private corporation. This structure perpetuates a radically inefficient extractive system full of coercive risks, compared to a decentralized ledger system.

Our market's tabulators should not need multiple different methods to remedy the overvoting of beneficial share entitlements.[^overvoting-fabrication] These inefficiencies only exist because of the rampant propagation of clearing FTDs since the 1994 amendment of the UCC.[^UCC-year]

As the Commission knows, Article 8 of the UCC created these entitlements in 1994, legally separating investors from what was previously their property so that brokers could employ them for their own collateral. However, as we'll find meaningful later, the DTC's lawyers already had States make the requisite custodianship operational efficiency change in 1972.[^BASIC-UCC] Upon an electronic-record modernization update in 1978, the UCC contained all required intermediary rights and protections to offer margin accounts and associated hypothecation products.[^FSU-UCC]

Holy fucking shit, they can't have FTDs because "Under revised Article 8, there can be only one registered pledge of an uncertificated security at a time." at 883.
Statute citation is note 114.

Plainly, there were no FTDs before the 1994 amendments to the UCC. --I wonder if SEC comm staff aware of this? I would expect that they would be, it's a pretty major part of the infrastructure history--
^ go into the 86 and 88 history from Jack, others

The ULC argues in _infra_ note 41.

Information on how the system worked for custodianship and immobilization is in 61 to 64.


[^pers]: I also sincerely appreciated the technical excellence showcased in the proposition, beta testing, and present implementation of EDGAR Next.

[^UCC-year]: While we appreciate that about half of our great Nation's States amended their codes two years ago, particularly section 8 thereof, these changes do not address the material concerns we have over the protection of investor assets held in retirement, health-savings, or any other entitlement accounts. We will detail these challenges later, which were introduced in their entirety in the 1994 amendments.

[^overvoting-fabrication]: _See, e.g.,_ an internal transfer agent service document describing six ways to truncate or otherwise throw out votes in elections where more shares are voted than exist, _available at_ https://wooten.link/overvoting-fabrication.

[^BASIC-UCC]: _See_ remarks on the BANKING AND SECURITIES INDUSTRY COMMITTEE amendments to UCC in 1972, mentioned in the concept release at n.62, enabling the custodianship and immobilization necessary for margin loans, _available at_ https://www.sechistorical.org/collection/papers/1980/1984_0401_BasicTeamwork_1.pdf#page=69. Upon the adoption of these new State laws, "DTC commenced taking steps to implement the long-desired broadening of its ownership, even though a small percentage of its eligible issues would be from non-enacting states." As the Commission knows, this ownership stake often exceeds 99.9% of public issuers, presenting an immense centralization risk should its nominee partnership face any threats.

[^FSU-UCC]: _See_ Florida State University Law Review's article: _A Critical Look at Secured Transactions Under Revised UCC Article 8_, _available at_ https://ir.law.fsu.edu/lr/vol14/iss4/2. In 1987, Dr. Paul B. Rasor, Ph.D. therein states:
> The extension of Article 8 to uncertified shareholder interests did not have anything to do with the problems of secured lenders. Instead, it grew out of the so-called "paperwork crunch" which came to a head in the late 1960s in the securities industry... financial intermediaries and other bailees will presumably have records showing which notices were received when. Nothing in the revised Article 8 affects this.

### Institutional Failings and the Case for Direct Registration

In segueing to institutional failings, let's incorporate the change in tone from a prominent case study of growing direct registration. This is also an example of growing needs for the DRS system to compete with the custodial holding infrastructure, now possibly thanks to the efficiencies availed by blockchain.

_(In Establishing Standards)_

[^]: _See, e.g.,_ uncertainty and standardization in the reporting of Direct Registration System holdings at one well-known issuer, _available at_ https://www.drsgme.org/drs-reporting. A third-quarter 2022 filing states a specific number of shares "directly registered with our transfer agent." _Compare_ this specificity to the "held by record holders" language used in reports thereafter. Should the DTCC's FAST agreements be required to delineate directly registered shares?

Specific reports probably just remove:

## Coinbase

I share the Commission's stated public view that Coinbase Global, Inc.[^cb-light] ("Coinbase") presents a brazen overstepping of "well-established principles of the federal securities laws."[^cb-suit-main] It shook me to the bone when I heard Coinbase's chief legal counsel say that their only licensure was state money transmission reporting at SFVegas 2021.[^title] As a user of this centralized platform since 2017, I found enforced policies and procedures meaningfully questionable, as at least three accounts I control have been unilaterally shut down or meaningfully restricted.[^723-basis-date]

These instances concern me because I am a law-abiding American citizen who's gone out of my way to report otherwise pseudonymous, unregulated, and profitable on-chain trading venues.[^btc-lev-report] Moreover, the accounts of family members I've seen restricted, all of whom live in similar circumstances, by and large, came without any advanced warning or corrective action avenues. As someone who's had many links to the financial system permanently severed before,[^jw-debanking] this unilateral, opaque, and coercive central control from Coinbase surprised me given their public-facing mission to "increase economic freedom in the world."[^cb-s1]

Around the time Coinbase decided to close down its longstanding nonprofit initiative, I helped my partner open a Coinbase account so that she could deposit U.S. dollars onto the Stellar network. The purpose of these funds was to invest in an asset tradable on a decentralized exchange. When opening the account, we answered all questions indicating such intentions, provided all requested PII, and linked her bank account.

Within a few months, it was time to acquire the asset I wanted my partner to invest in. The price was ready to break out, so we started depositing funds into the account. Over the course of at least three months, my partner deposited her savings with Coinbase to acquire USD Coin ("USDC") and subsequently withdraw those tokens onto her blockchain wallet, as established offline and initialized through a hardware security device. These funds originated in part from her full-time employment and in part from a parental graduation gift upon her completion of college last year.

At least three initial deposits from Coinbase into my partner's wallet went fine, and she slowly accumulated the target asset. At no point did my partner send any assets to other wallets through a direct transfer. Moreover, she never interacted with any smart contracts that could implicate "impermissible activities." It was a very simple distributed-ledger account that received funds and used them to acquire assets.

Then, my partner received a bonus from work roughly equivalent to half her portfolio. Thereafter, she deposited a majority of the funds into Coinbase, where we expected to wait a couple of days for the transfer to clear.[^banking-BS] On 14 Oct 2024, she received this email, given with original emphasis:

> Coinbase takes several steps to keep your account safe, and we actively monitor for unusual activity and scams that may affect our customers. **Based on this monitoring, we are concerned you may have sent, or are trying to send, crypto to a fraudulent person or platform.** Out of an abundance of caution and to protect you against potential losses, we have temporarily **limited your ability to send additional crypto until November 14, 2024.** This restriction will be removed automatically after the set time period elapses.

This was extremely concerning given my past experiences trading financial assets. I began acquiring this particular asset for my partner months prior because I knew it would materially increase in value. Indeed, in a transaction four days before this communication, I invested the last of my USDC savings into this asset given its technical breakout setup.[^john-acquisition]

My partner had been asked to submit facial scans and identification documents to Coinbase before, so we were surprised by the recurrent request to complete a "government check" of her physical credentials. We completed this document submission and liveness ascertainment at least three times so as to satisfy Coinbase. We received an affirmative acceptance by an automated system, but the Coinbase interface still said my partner could not transfer her USDC for an entire month "as a precautionary measure, to protect you against potential loss."

In the interim waiting period, Coinbase maintained my partner's ability to buy the target asset through their centralized exchange interface. However, the only available trading option required at least a 1% commission on top of a three-figure trading fee. Comparatively, the free decentralized exchange on the network offers the same service without the risk of front-running.[^Garand-story] Accordingly, and in the capitalist principle of not supporting businesses which I despise, I refuse to trade on a centralized exchange what can otherwise be transacted on a decentralized exchange.[^cex-dex]

Over a week later on the 23rd, my partner received an email declaring that Coinbase had "completed your account review, and buy/send/deposit services remain disabled at this time." When logging into the Coinbase website, she was greeted with a new message stating her account could no longer send any assets at any time as "a precautionary measure, to protect you against potential loss." Since this was worded similarly to the last message, I assumed she could transfer them later, such as the original November date given such comprehensive disclosure of personal information.

At the time, my partner had no other option to deposit funds into her wallet in a timely manner. Indeed, transferring back to her bank account would take days before another days-long wait to any alternatives, which then imposed their own holding-period transfer restrictions. Thus, she was stuck with the funds sitting in her account, unable to send them anywhere they could be bridged over to the decentralized exchange. Does the Commission tolerate this lethargic processing of customer deposits?[^debank]

Upon checking back on the account on the original release date three weeks later, I found the same message that all transfers were disallowed. This was quite frustrating because the price of the target asset had increased by more than 30% while we waited for the deposit to process. Notwithstanding, I meticulously checked the account each day thereafter, until a new message appeared over two weeks later on the 29th:

> We are reviewing your account. This process can take up to 3 days.

At this point, the value of the target asset had increased by a factor of six. This was materially concerning because the profit on that trade would have been approximately twice my partner's pre-tax annual income. In the next three days, the target asset continued to appreciate while Coinbase reviewed her account.

[^btc-lev-report]: Some of this activity was required because Coinbase chooses not to submit brokerage-style transaction reports to the IRS. Others resulted in my previously communicated use of unregulated exchanges, which served as the only point of access available to certain markets. And still many more, including transactions reported for the Syndicate, arose from the nature of decentralized exchanges, which cannot effectuate cost-basis or capital-gains reporting to the government given their lack of a financial intermediary. _See also, relevantly,_ departing Commissioner Gensler's pragmatic remarks on taking a nuanced, practiced, and mature approach to regulating such protocols, _available at_ [https://wooten.link/OCC](https://wooten.link/OCC) n.46.

[^jw-debanking]: _See, e.g.,_ unexpected account termination at an institution largely influenced by Coinbase and its infrastructure, _available at_ https://x.com/JFWooten4/status/1814252066300207611. I have had similar experiences with corporate accounts at Coinbase whereby they would comprehensively approve my business given complete and full entity disclosures, only to remove such authorization as soon as any meaningful transactions process on-chain. This experience reminds me of a banking institution that found cause to investigate my corporate account after a transaction well below the Suspicious Activity Reporting ("SAR") threshold. After I did not answer their phone calls for 48 hours, they closed the account with a significant history of operating as the day-to-day treasury funds for team members. Upon later contacting this institution, they told me that the account was closed because I "walked into a branch and requested so." This did not occur, so I asked the account representative to check back with their team. Approximately two weeks later, we had another call where this employee reaffirmed that I physically closed the account in a local branch. However, this would be impossible because I was on holiday in Switzerland at the time of the alleged visit, and this bank did not have any branches in Switzerland. Does the Commission believe transactional oversight should extend so far as to terminate one's ability to participate in the financial system just because their phone does not have signal in a foreign country?

The filing uses the phrase "a more fair, accessible, efficient, and transparent financial system" at least three times as generally promoting an open network for the world. At 121, they also tout traditional banking services "from offering compounding rewards on savings that pay out by the second to compensating users for virtually completing tasks through global micropayments."

[^banking-BS]: As staff know, the American banking system often takes multiple days to transfer funds between accounts. Unfortunate as this is, Coinbase worsens the process for acquisitions of USDC by traditionally disallowing blockchain transfers for at least a week after this period. Accordingly, any transaction intent on blockchain asset acquisitions from a bank account forces users to gamble that the price won't materially increase during the extensive waiting period.

Given the nonexistence of a national market system for cryptocurrencies and a generally international market for their central exchange, does the Commission believe staff can efficiently oversee all forthcoming trading and registration supervision? Or would staff prefer an updated system based on the decentralized governance ethos commonly underlying these common endeavors which are so often paired with decentralized exchanges?

[^cex-dex]: Namely, all mainstream instances of the former type operate solely on a profit-driven proprietary business model. Often these entities fundraise from the investing public in an effort to sustain their enterprise, which exists exclusively due to fees later charged for trading services. I find this particularly concerning because exchanges and liquidity have a well-known "lock-in" effect whereby the network effect of bids and offers accrues exclusively to the provider of an exchange venue. As staff know, Wall Street perpetually uses this value for bribing introducing brokers for order flow, which hinders price discovery through met supply and demand.

[^debank]: _See also_ Congressional industry sentiment impeding technological growth in our great Nation by revoking access to the legacy interbank payment and account network, _available at_ https://youtu.be/WgjUM8U81FY?t=4639. Might distributed ledger technologies and decentralized governance offer a resilient and transparent record of investor assets? Could they at least challenge the "brick wall" of opacity and nonresponsive support options present at central intermediaries like Coinbase?

### Parallel Experience

Sluggish financial intermediaries are no surprise to our community. Many international investors have needed

First BTC top too

Still restricted

The "intermediation failure" part can be laid out without explicit DTCC reference through the other institutions. It will just need to lightly implicate that this is all based on the links commonly underlying the whole framework.

The one item I'd like to add in a footnote here or in the 144 no-action:
There was a call between Coinbase and staff discussing their purported TA/ATS structure, which gives rise to clearing agent participation. They claim to ignore this and argue that it does not apply&mdash;hurr durr >?>WAS>&mdash;lol at App. A ¶ 24,

### Cap One

16 Jan 2025: Email
**System issue impacting deposits, payments, and transfers**
"We began experiencing a disruption impacting the processing of some deposits, payments, and transfers, which is due to a technical issue with one of our service providers."

Implicates the 400k monthly chat from May 2024 (most likely on the 28th without checking the calendar) (spanned into June 12).
"Specifically, this has delayed processing of some transactions, including direct deposits and Early Pay credit for direct deposits, as well as **electronic payments and transfers (ACH).**" [emphasis added]

### Robinhood Login Instance

As with the Coinbase interface and other private markets, we can harp here on the identity flaws and inefficiencies by means of the:

16 Jan 2025:
At least a third request to submit ID to "activate crypto transfers," which initially started as a requisite to log in, despite material existing Roth assets&mdash;
which, of course, can't even link to the main bank account....

- The request initially began as a requirement just to log in.
- The system still does not allow linking to the main bank account.

Same as Green Dot/Citi

### Broker Inactivity – Key Facts

#### Closure, Inactivity

6 Nov 2024 email: "Login to your account to avoid a $25 inactivity fee" stated, "Our records show that it has been approximately six months since you have logged into your SoFi Investment account(s). **Please log in by end of day 11/15/2024 to avoid a $25 inactivity fee.**"

A $25 fee was charged on 20 Nov 2024, effected by selling 0.1 shares of the account on 21 Nov. The remainder was sold, and the account was closed on 25 Nov.

#### Crypto as Origin

Email dated 6 Dec 2023 indicated, "Crypto services ending soon" and "SoFi will be discontinuing crypto services on December 19, 2023."

"You have until January 28, 2024, to sell your crypto holdings and close your crypto account."

This resulted in the disposition of Lumens bought at or about the price level on June 17, 2022. They were sold and credited to the broker account on 29 Jan 2024 (~20 x 51).

It also offers a stellar place to insert arguments against central intermediation of the transfer process.[^cb] Hopefully, these and additional emotional arguments around the last FOIA in OCC (24-01211-E) and more recently 25-00185-FOIA will push the Commission toward the 501(c)(3)'s side. :)

Recently, inadequate administrative procedures of an unreliable central broker cost me and my partner $100k in the last couple of months.

## Fidelity

Transferred ACH into account at the start of the year.
Wanted to put it into a 2024 Roth contribution (cannot make this internal transfer until the end of the period&mdash;just for investing in our great nation's assets, which aren't even truly owned...).
Can't&mdash;need to wait at least three weeks for cash to settle for "protection of my account," even though banking Reg E specifically puts liability on the intermediary.
- Extrapolates into the Coinbase argument (still unresolved) and client verification and ID problem solved by crypto/Nakamoto.

## Dental Insurance (Framed as Intermediation)

- 17 Dec 2024: Dental procedure.
- 14 Jan 2025: Check issued and dated but arrived at the dentist's office even though insurance directed it to the home address.
- 24 Jan 2025: Received it after a handwritten address was read incorrectly by the mail system and delivered to one of our neighbors, who opened the check.

Also parallels Green Dot failure and impact on unprocessed autopay → cancellation, need to "call my bank."

## Open Source Community

I started drafting this letter in true form after an opening community discussion[^GH-discussion] in our growing public GitHub collaboration system. Thereafter, we discussed the contents and implications of these policy amendments at depth.[^TS-TAR-ep] More broadly, we've been discussing the necessary structural changes and adoption plans for the better part of a year in our collective Discord server, as is additionally common in modern blockchain development groups.[^Discord-GME]

Indeed, we've produced a mountain of pioneering research, actively clarifying meaningful ownership concepts[^heat-lamp] alongside the Commission's helpful stewardship. Remarkably, as someone new to the community these last couple of years (canonically), all this action took place with no central coordinator, no compensation mechanism, and no legal offices. We live in a very different time than the days past when our current systems originated.[^diff-time] Given the burgeoning environment... does the Commission believe XYZ is more masculine... now is the time for a new and tested system?


Regardless of the risk surrounding SROs, millions of American investors risk the insolvency of transfer agent nominees --do you think it's worth expanding here on the idea that in UK there is a forced legal disclosure from TAs stating plainly that in case of nominee insolvency they are responsible to make investors whole, but for US TA operations there is no similar requirement?-- (or third-party administrators, as the case may be). Given the frequent complex relationships between such custodians and broker-dealers, any mishandling of securities lending practices could place the most direct form of employer-sponsored retirement savings in risky hands. Given Wall Street has been known for decades to mismark short positions as long,[^recently] do staff believe that nominee administrators' model of grabbing investor services "at no charge or for a modest fee"[^free-quote] can sustain the bookkeeping prudence costs associated with largely state-overseen holding compliance?

Our shared developments these past few years have shown me just how efficiently online forums and collaborative working tools organize otherwise disparate individual investor and financial-system advocates. With this basis, we can directly, specifically, and immutably process thoughts and inspirations into production codebases processing material amounts of value, such as Bitcoin.[^this-comment] Given DTCC has recently proposed a TAD-like collective securities ownership framework, we respectfully submit that any such system should be required to be open-sourced under a copyleft free software license to foster this collective collaboration.[^DTC-DA-study]

I really don't see a need to formally acknowledge this because it is a complete joke. That said, I think the competition arguments are apparent, and we can clearly infer the proprietary nature of much of it. The issue stems from the organizational setup&mdash;everything in terms of the study was conducted with no notice to the Commission or industry. That's a larger issue that ties into the whole open-source operations argument (so tackle in a separate location).

[^bailout-chat]: Relevant quotes from Jon Cunliffe, Deputy Governor for Financial Stability at the Bank of England from https://youtu.be/0PtULsOtI2o?t=9311:
"non-default losses could therefore wipe out the capital of the CCP and lead it to insolvency"
"the CCP rule book means it can effectively wind itself up without bankruptcy. The latter stages of that waterfall process could be systemically very damaging in the allocation of losses across the wider financial system"
"financial markets could disappear if we lose effective clearing services"
"the CCP service needs to be kept operating and the transmission of stress needs to be kept to a minimum"
"CCP capital is generally pretty small relative to the size of their operations"
“The first and this is a key issue for us is the question of incentives because our CCP equity is not going to be written down. In the case of default losses, do CCPs really have the right incentives to risk manage properly, particularly when they're in competition as many are internationally with other CCPs? And a point that's raised by the private sector is whether the allocation of losses between members on the one hand and CCP owners on the other is unfair because it's very little CCP skin in the game when the losses are mutualized."
"I think we're going to be in a pretty heavy systemic crisis... a reservoir of pre-funded resources that can be accessed only in resolution might be necessary to enable CCP clearing service to continue to operate."
"When you talk to the clearing members at very senior levels, they say they're worried about the risk in CCPs and the fact that they are exposed to these risks, both the neutralized default and the non-default. And they 
don't have kind of enough influence on the CCPs.”

Namely, we have confirmed through discussions, conversations, and by definitive website "Q&A section" updates certain operations by a leading transfer agent that allow shares held in a directly-registered investor's name to be swept into agent nominee custodianship without due notice or consent should such an investor enroll in an issuer plan, be it directly shelved on an S-3 or not voluntarily perpetuated by issuers themselves. While the release does mention this option as a possibility for known brokered holdings, I find it materially worrisome given the declared holding of plan-custodian nominee shares in a DTCC/Cede account at a market broker for the sake of accessing trading liquidity. --I might temper this section a bit, I think we can be very clear about what's been admitted to but also be clear about what we don't know regarding the Dingo nominee holdings and the subsection held with Cede--

Many in our community are increasingly wary of the centralizing control over these plan holdings given the nature of omnibus intermingling. _See also, e.g.,_ comments questioning why a leading public American bank, which disposed of its transfer agency division eight years ago, recently stopped using the purchaser thereof for their own recordkeeping services&mdash;possibly due to the jurisdictional nature and enhanced custodianship laws associated therewith, _available at_ https://x.com/ValueOrion/status/1883579855620776241.

The technologies we have today vastly outmatch the infrastructure in place during the origins (and in many cases, the continuing present operations) of today's SRO monopolies. And it's my interpretation after conversation with a C-suite executive therewith (or those closely related) that the change and efficiency improvement promises inherent in transparent and accountable distributed ledger technologies will come only from a grassroots community-led effort such as ours.

Without the ability for a public review of an open accounting standard, I respectfully submit to the Commission that we risk material proprietary software errors ~~such as those previously identified~~ should our most crucial financial intermediaries in the Custodial Structure continue ignoring the dominant open-source security hardening benefits freely available to public code repositories. <!-- href here next time with quote from Jerry -->

### Specific UCC Changes from Don Grande

> Allowing massive institutions, many of which are worth hundreds of billions of dollars, to have priority over security entitlements belonging to individual investors creates massive distortions in the marketplace that could ultimately hasten a large economic crash. But even if this were not the case, an important question for policymakers remains: Is a system truly worthy of saving if it would happily sacrifice individual investors' wealth to save allegedly too-big-to-fail institutions? <!-- TAR2: Securrency "too bigger to fail" extrapolation here -->

they write:
> No. The security entitlement holder does not have rights attaching to particular securities in the pool, he has a _pro rata_ share of the interests in the financial asset held by its securities intermediary to the amount needed to satisfy the aggregate claims of the entitlement holders in that issue. This is true even if investor positions are "segregated."

v. the board on DTCC
I don't think we touched on this yet.
Perhaps implicate it lightly with identification and name-dropping of the select few worst offenders thereto.

#### Chives' thoughts

--will need to reformat section into direct response to the DTCC blockchain study which has been mentioned a few times already--

The diagram on 112 is simple and fantastic, in my opinion. It doesn't cover custody, but it doesn't need to be appreciated&mdash;types of assets and implied claims therein.

I also think the tokenization explainers on 113 are fantastic. "Tokenization has the potential to unlock the benefits of programmable, interoperable ledgers to a wider array of legacy financial assets," with a graphic to the right establishing where relevant data is stored (ideally, a public read blockchain, but similar to DTCC, this is unspecified). **SIDEBAR** - WhyDRS could use articles breaking down tokenization in a similar way but from a custodial perspective, relating it to a title deed in a safe if holding the private key.

"The benefits of tokenization extend far beyond and are independent of native crypto assets like Bitcoin, as well as the public, permissionless blockchain technology those assets have popularized" - (114) Spoke too soon. Giving away the game here, aren't they? --> Leads into the unified ledger section you highlighted --> Must "be developed under the auspices of central banks."

"Cybersecurity Threats: Certain types of DLT solutions (public, permissionless blockchains) are vulnerable to hacking and other cybersecurity attacks, which could pose risks to the security of tokenized Treasuries" - (118) Maybe in the case specifically of a Treasury issued by a nation-state, I could appreciate the point here. Typically, public permissionless is my preference.

Under concerns, they include:
Increased Complexity and Opacity:
− Tokenization leads to more composability, which could significantly add complexity and opacity to the financial system from new and non-traditional assets being added to the digital financial ecosystem.
− Improperly coded smart contracts can rapidly trigger unwanted financial transactions with unintended consequences.

Page 120 is borrowed from https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/DASCPWhitePaper.pdf, which I don't think I'd read before&mdash;some new homework.

## Bank Transfers

Initiated Dec 18, 2024, from CB. Still awaiting KYC.
To WF due to no support for LR via either manual or Plaid as the only option.
Estimated standard 2-day transfer.

On Dec 20, 2024, WF performed an RTP instant transfer to LR.
Placed on hold until Dec 27, 2024.

Received at least three calls from LR and a compliance email mandating a call by Dec 26, 2024, at 3 PM ET:
"Please give us a call today 12/26 before 3 PM EST," stated in virtual 'secure' webmail at 10:49 AM ET.
"We are reaching out to ask for your help verifying some information."

## Share Donation Section

Possibly a good idea to start with the natural monopoly conversation and implications of a shared standard like NSCC-ish.

> If ultimate economic power is to be placed in the hands of commercial corporation, as is now the trend, democracy will live only in words, not in reality, for corporate governance of such organization is the antithesis of democracy&mdash;or of equity and justice, for that matter.
> 
> &mdash;Dee Hock

I agree with the late Visa network founder's thesis that the infrastructure underlying our markets should not lie in the corruptible hands of a select few industry intermediaries. We've seen the further and further consolidation of DTCC and its natural squashing of transfer-agent innovation. Now is the time for a new, parallel rail available to investors seeking direct custody of their investment securities. It is my understanding that the present administration made a promise to keep us fortified from Wall Street's "predatory short selling," resulting in the FTD problem.[^RFK-camp]

[^RFK-camp]: _See_ pending cabinet appointees' sentiments in prior campaigning efforts, _available at_ https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1792970117204287992. Given the martial support Kennedy lent towards the administration's ultimate victory in final public-decision moments, might we keep the promise to our great Nation's individual investors? A commitment to establish "a free and fair market" with "aggressive Wall Street reforms" based around "greater transparency" could be easily implemented with a blockchain securities trading and settlement system.

As the Commission knows, I am also the founder of a registered transfer agent operating using the public open-source blockchain system communicated in previous letters. As shared, I have built this system over the course of many years of technical analysis, regulatory study, and Pythonic implementation.[^repos] As the primary contributor to these efforts, I still both retain all shares in the agent and control the licensing nature of my work.

[^repos]: _See_ primary implementation of trading infrastructure on GitHub, _available at_ https://github.com/blocktransfer/py-TAD3-horizon.

I have chosen to release the vast majority of Syndicate GitHub code under expressly permissive copyleft free software licenses.[^FOSS] This allows any agents to deploy our securities management infrastructure on top of the blockchain for fast, accurate, and automatic record-keeping, including on-chain restrictive-legend removals under 17 C.F.R. § 230.144. By the nature of this open-source technology, the parent agent corporation cannot restrict or otherwise manage oversight into agents deploying the permissionless-ethos system.

[^FOSS]: _See_ community discussion as to licensing implications, _available at_ https://wooten.link/GNU. As for limited implementation progression, _See also_ pending open-source work without ending policies, _available at_ https://github.com/blocktransfer/investor-app and https://github.com/blocktransfer/issuerlink. It is my express intention to maintain a deference and employment of Affero amongst all continuing Syndicate work, or its equivalent for documentation efforts.

### Natural Monopoly Risk

Accordingly, it's my intention to donate my shares in the company to WhyDRS, presuming that's something the community would like to happen. I am still weeding through the legalities and tax implications of this transfer given the treatment of interest under 26 U.S.C. § 1361(b)(1)(B), _inter alia._ Notwithstanding, I intend to give out the details here in a manner that grants the Association binding and enforceable control over the company.

Firstly, I would appreciate a reply from staff within 90 days as to the ownership of a blockchain transfer agent by the DUNA, as such a nonprofit arrangement mimics existing regulatory-oversight schemes availed of Federal recognition. Implications from the Commission's response to this gift could materially assist community members with an analysis of whether or not to accept the shares. Namely, this combination of equals into a superstructure for public infrastructure quite directly raises the participatory and reputational bar for our ongoing social efforts toward efficient markets.

--Love this John, I wish I'd seen it sooner to compliment you on the gumption and forethought to see direct comment from the SEC on this intention.--

Secondly, maybe we can introduce putting this out to comment again.

What we need should DTC fail is nothing short of a completely new (inter)national market system.[^global] I find the prospects of such a market controlled by one private corporation bleak. Given past experience shows the centralizing tendency of good clearing infrastructure,[^DTCC-path]

[^global]: In such an interconnected era with profound technological abundance, I see only inevitably the emergence of a global stock market. I earnestly hope that our great Nation will continue leading the forefront of the world's capital market by supporting this work. _See also_ work in a number of foreign nations implementing an inter-agency Direct Registration System, _available at_ https://ijlr.iledu.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/V3I205.pdf#page=3.

# WF DTC Interactions on a More Institutionalized Side (Notes)

Presumes a transitory framing of collaborating with brokers by positioning as replacing the DTCC and empowering them with a more efficient clearing and settlement system.

### Dad Call

- Received a legal document from WF authorizing signatures with wet signatures.
- Did not require medallions or ID certifications.¶
- As commonplace in past chats, they rely on obtaining a "[legal] opinion from a big law firm, and if something goes wrong, they just sue the big law firm."

Emailed DTC only.
Did not conduct a call for that offering.
(Implications of past TA email fraud on a $9M wire item.)

Bank DWAC'd it out and can DWAC back to own custody via physical certificate.

We would greatly appreciate it if the Commission could kindly put this subject up for review in a new proposed rule by the second quarter. (## Careful here)

Recently, my partner hit a cat on her drive home from work. Reflecting on the moment, she remarked that she "knew she was supposed to brake" but was in a late-night panic after a hard day. On approach, she swerved to avoid the cat, but unfortunately, it ran in the direction she swerved.

There was a small mud spot on the tire, but I didn't have a tire cleaning product. Once I finished, I drove it into the garage and tried to clean it. Even though there was only one dirty area, I had to wipe down the whole tire because it was too dark to see the blemish.

The Commission introduced the Central Certificate Service ("CCS") in the context of the Unsanctioned Practices Study ("UPS").[^nyse-intro]

[^nyse-intro]: _See_ concept release at n.45. Have staff contemplated the treatment of nominee partnership depositories in the context of securities with higher circulating brokerage supply than legal outstanding issuance? Namely, an issuer popular with individual investors went bankrupt two years ago with a disproportionate proposition of shares outstanding compared to those held under the Custodial Structure according to centralized FAST declarative ownership data. The issuer's bankruptcy filings showed the CCS street-name partnership nominee referenced as owning 776,404,408 common shares, _available at_ https://wooten.link/kroll-cede at 8. However, the issuer's books and records at the transfer agent recorded only 739,056,836 shares outstanding four days after the bankruptcy capitalization table, _available at_ https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000088615823000059/bbby-20230225.htm at 2. Thus, it would be impossible for all partnership nominee claimants to bear rights to common stock in this enterprise.

Might we consider “hitting the brakes” on the markets while we publicly review the full extent of ownership diffusion across the industry? (phrased more diplomatically in reference to the Commission). Might this approach allow us to uncover the best course of action if an extensive external audit reveals a material commandeering of American investor assets?[Dole]

#### Highlights the paramount importance of maintaining confidence in our financial systems and the United States dollar

TBD, but the easiest hook point will probably be its universal basis of quantification; try to customize with any crypto securities team quotes given time.

It might be close, but I know this will sink the hook in well.

Then let's extrapolate this into making the SRO clearing numbers transparent so that everyone can see the baseline market data on top of the limited existing FTD and SIP disclosures. This draws along the parallel of seeing the flooring light past Moozooz's obstruction without touching the existing gated systems. So, to add to the three negotiating fronts, we can introduce circular data access&mdash;a natural aspect of the TAD system&mdash;given that investors would require access to the same ownership information collaboratively shared between agents in a cooperative system.

Please wrap it up with something a little more inspirational from the depths of an equality standpoint. Everything here started around a radical change in social monetary and financial system organization with Nixon's depegging, and I want so dearly to convey that sentiment in saving securities themselves from the same fate. 💜

## Good quotes from Crypto 2.0 leaders

On the central clearing of Treasuries in 2023, Pierce writes:

> Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke explained that: "[T]he historical record shows that clearinghouse arrangements have generally withstood even severe crises. This solid performance reflects good planning and sound institutional structures but also some degree of good luck, as crises have also revealed important vulnerabilities, vulnerabilities which prompted subsequent reforms by both the private and public sectors." Good luck is not a strategy, so why can I be confident that Treasury clearinghouses will perform even in times of market stress?

Peirce and Uyeda dissent on last year's electronic modernization through (inline) XBRL and custom XMLs:

> Like any technology, specific structured data languages can become obsolete—similar to how the "write once, read many" technological storage format (i.e., CD-ROM) for broker-dealer books and records remained a rule requirement far beyond its useful life.

### Gensler moinoply privatization reform note

Robert A. F. Reisner

"Reisner drew up a privatization plan referred to as “the endgame strategy.” Reisner began talking to Gary Gensler, the Treasury Department’s undersecretary for domestic finance, about how it might work. In 2000, Henderson and Reisner met with Elaine Kamarck, a senior staff member in the Clinton administration. Kamarck listened as Reisner talked about the USPS’s challenges and raised the possibility of privatization. Then she reminded them that Vice President Al Gore was running for president. “Well, we would have to ask our union friends,” she said. “You know, they are critical to the upcoming campaign.” Soon after, Gensler called Reisner and told him there would be no more discussions about privatization. “We’re putting this on the back burner,” Gensler said.

It was always clear to Henderson that the postal workers’ union had more political influence with the Clinton White House than he did."

Bank of New York repaid the loan Friday

> Bank of New York incurred an estimated $4 million interest expense on the borrowing, the bank said any impact on its net income "will not be material." For the first nine months this year, earnings totaled $96.7 million.

> the primary error occurred in a messaging system which buffered messages going in and out of the bank. The actual error was an overflow in a counter which was only 16 bits wide, instead of the usual 32. This caused a message database to become corrupted. The programmers and operators, working under tremendous pressure to solve the problem quickly, accidently copied the corrupt copy of the database over the backup, instead of the other way around.
> 
> The Bank of New York, the nation's 18th largest, had a brief $32 billion overdraft on its cash account at the New York Federal Reserve Bank when a computer failure last month snarled thousands of government securities transactions, a congressional committee was told yesterday. By the end of the day, the overdraft had been reduced to $24 billion, and the bank actually had to borrow that amount from the New York Fed -- pledging all of its assets -- in order to balance its accounts overnight.

### by John M. Berry, _Washington Post_ (_Id._)

> Aside from the unprecedented scale of the borrowing, and the spillover effects on the government securities market, the incident intensified concern at the Federal Reserve over the vulnerability of the nation's financial payments system to a technological glitch that could have disastrous consequences. Federal Reserve ChairmanPaul A. Volcker and New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan went before a House Banking subcommittee yesterday to describe how the computer failure occurred and how the Fed and the bank dealt with the crisis it caused. 
> 
> The New York Fed was automatically taking money out of the Bank of New York's cash account to pay the sellers for the incoming securities, all of which are represented simply by computer records, rather than the familiar paper bonds still used by most corporations.
> 
> The Fed kept both its nationwide wires for securities and cash transactions open in the early hours of Friday morning. When the patch failed, the Bank of New York was still able to borrow $700 million from other banks. The rest was covered by a $23.6 billion loan from the New York Fed. As collateral, the bank pledged all its domestic assets and all its customers' securities it was allowed to use for such purposes.


> But, meanwhile, the rest of the government securities industry had begun its Friday activities, and securities and an overdraft were piling up



> Another part, Corrigan said, was that Thursday was not an especially heavy day for securities transactions.
> 
> One government securities trader summed up the situation this way. "We're all afraid something will go bump and send the market into a tailspin.
