# Document


Dear Ms. Countryman and Mr. (Chair?) Atkins,

When I was a boy in high school,  is tgna researhcngi the stokc market. AT th e tiem , I was working a minimum-wage job at Subway every spare weeknight or weekend double. I'd walk aout half and hour to and ffrom the store in the latter case when my Mom was caught u p at wrok. In the fleeting moments I had between classes and later athetics, I turned all my spare attention to our great investing indstury becuase it promised a way out of the daily servitutde.

In just one abrief lifetime, we've seen our grat nation 's market system attract and expact to households from all ends of society. While only the affluient and wealthy might have access to the securitie's of a distant physical past, today's most meager invbestors can trade on a fair playing groupnd with the same opporuntiies for growth.[^thf]

[^thf]: Cite Robhinhood triplicate from discussion on fractionalized share pushback froi miunstruyd. I kjhow we all know the teruth here, but there isn't a better way to introduce the narrative imo.

Or at least, it;s supposed to be a fair equivalency. Because I was only 16 after months of resarching the market, brokers wound;t extend an account uydner my name./ It was these early trades outside my own control that shapesd my undeying passion for efficient securities markets . Buty an investor's portfdolio shouldn't be outside of thier control. Indeed, I expect quite reasonably that a stock be registered and owned outright in my name when I pay good money to its seller. Do you agree that one's portfolio should be their own property?

Unfortunatley, this is not the case of toda's market functions, no matter your age. Indeed, it hasn't been the case since the unstuttured monopolization of the clearing and setrtlemtn  market many decades ago, despite both the COmmission and Congfress' best efferts.[^mon] For decades this reality has narrowly averted public catastory.[^lehman] But we can no longer ignore the pressing realities of these systemic idiosynchratic risks.

{{Eight}} /**Check with dDOn on the official number here**/
A,merocam States have introduced legislation undermining the conceit and contrusions DTCC's agents introduced into the 1994 Universal Commerican Code.[^DTCcs] Quite soon, a select ferw States reconsitute the right of investors to their own portfolios as a due property law. When this happens,e I am extremely concerned with the solvence of Cede  & Co. shoudl any number of intitutional custodians relocate to such jurisdictions to reap the enhanced protections promised by our shared ideologies.

[^DTCcs]: i want direct quoters here focuseyd by and large on the agent part. the legistlative reform should stay in the main argument. https://fmlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Issue-3-Background-paper-on-Article-8-of-the-Uniform-Commercial-Code.pdf#page=8 "security entitlements"

This was orignally frames around th `./pending/S7-DC-25.md` content, wich provides the full scope of reference material. That said, the departure of Genslar and Appointment of Atkins seems an opportune time to have this content refreshed given the emmergence of a TAD after the publication of the rule. It can also be a stellar  place to insert the arguments against centranl itnermediation of the transfer process.[^cb] Hopefully these and some other emotinoa;l argumetns around the last FOIA in OCC (24-01211-E) and more recently 25-00185-FOIA will push the COmmission over towards the 501c3's side :)

[^cb]: I have and will insert a story of how recent administrative procedures of an unreliable central broker cost me and my partner 100k in these last couple months.

### Few sentences on alternative by means of obviation

- Stellar is one of the very few platforms that accounts for liquidity at scale with no centralized party (as associated with grease in the wheels argument, and implicated larger scale).
- The Stellar network takes a crowdsourced approach to liquidity. Namely, the SDEX gives all users equal access to a global decentralized order book for any pair of assets on he network. Since launching with the genesis of the Stellar network in 2014, the SDEX has processed over 4.6 billion trades worth upwards of $26 billion. [fn]

> UCC 8-503 and UCC 8-511. 

> 8-503 mentions the 2 exceptions giving certain secured creditors priority over entitlement holders in 8-511 so we strike that reference to 8-511.
