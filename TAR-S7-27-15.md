# Document


Dear Ms. Countryman and Mr. (Chair?) Atkins,

When I was a boy in high school, I began researching the stock market. At the time, I was working a minimum-wage job at Subway every spare weeknight or weekend double. I'd walk about half an hour to and from the store in the latter case when my mom was caught up at work. In the fleeting moments I had between classes and later athletics, I turned all my spare attention to our great investing industry because it promised a way out of the daily servitude.

In just one brief lifetime, we've seen our great nation's market system attract and expand to households from all ends of society. While only the affluent and wealthy might have had access to the securities of a distant physical past, today's most meager investors can trade on a fair playing ground with the same opportunities for growth.[^thf]

[^thf]: Cite Robinhood triplicate from discussion on fractionalized share pushback from industry. I know we all know the truth here, but there isn't a better way to introduce the narrative imo.

Or at least, it's supposed to be a fair equivalency. Because I was only 16 after months of researching the market, brokers wouldn't extend an account under my name. It was these early trades outside my own control that shaped my underlying passion for efficient securities markets. But an investor's portfolio shouldn't be outside of their control. Indeed, I expect quite reasonably that a stock be registered and owned outright in my name when I pay good money to its seller. Do you agree that one's portfolio should be their own property?

Unfortunately, this is not the case of today's market functions, no matter your age. Indeed, it hasn't been the case since the unstructured monopolization of the clearing and settlement market many decades ago, despite both the Commission and Congress' best efforts.[^mon] For decades this reality has narrowly averted public catastrophe.[^lehman] But we can no longer ignore the pressing realities of these systemic idiosyncratic risks.

American States have introduced legislation undermining the conceit and constructions DTCC's agents introduced into the 1994 Universal Commercial Code.[^DTCcs] Quite soon, a select few States reconstitute the right of investors to their own portfolios as a due property law. When this happens, I am extremely concerned with the solvency of Cede & Co. should any number of institutional custodians relocate to such jurisdictions to reap the enhanced protections promised by our shared ideologies.

[^DTCcs]: I want direct quotes here focused by and large on the agent part. The legislative reform should stay in the main argument. https://fmlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Issue-3-Background-paper-on-Article-8-of-the-Uniform-Commercial-Code.pdf#page=8 "security entitlements"

## Organizational Association

I am writing to you on behalf of WhyDRS, a decentralized unincorporated nonprofit association of thousands of individual investors. We are both the first American DUNA and a recently-approved public 501(c)(3) charitable organization. Our Association stemmed largely from the unprecedented shutdown of market operations of 28 Jan 2021.[^cong] Four years later, our great financial system still faces a well-known sweltering threat able to subvert even the most prudent rules set by this great Commission.

[^cong]: Cite the two hearings and the Congressional study with tenor-deep ethos

We sincerely appreciate staff's diligent efforts over the past few years of our collective outreach.[^ncs] Your response to our pressing concerns directly shaped the XYZ growth of our decentralized market of blockchain transfer agents XYZABC.[^gren] We respectfully submit to the Commission that now is the time to take action on the years of work industry innovators have built since the advent of widespread blockchain technologies in the past decade.

### Educating

Wall Streret stunned our community when theu inlaterally siezed our abiliy to aquisre a public security subject to no restrictions by the COmmissison. FGrom this tschock, our dricivng aND UNWAVIGN objective centereds around understanding the  "Rube Goldberg" machine Congress expects staff to effectively oversee on a daily basis. The gfurther many communtiy members dove into market strucutr,e the more clear it became that its reliance on a single faliable party exposes all investors to signficant risk.

Since these awekenging, we've made every effort tyo hsare and collecitvle yinform the public about the pending collapse of our central clearing countperartyt secutiries transfin and settlemetn rsystem ("CCP Regime"). Namely, the cocnentration of nearly all investment assets into a **limited patrtnership trust** presents unwardable conflicts of interest in the expandsion of collateral lending facilities, be them direct or implicated by operational polcieis. 

This point will become more readily apparant as further evcidnec edocuments in this comment. ONe key public article detailing the centralizty of theis fact existing on our website: "The DTC/Ceding Ownership - Choiuce without a Choice" (itliscs?)./ As the Commission knows, our great American cpaitlist syustem relies on voluntary exchange of goods and services. Issues cannot avail themselves of this basic benefit of free markjets because there exists no competitior to DTCC. In fact, such a proposition has been corecisiley deemed unactionable by some of our nationals leading "To Big to faiul" banks. We sincerely appreacite staff highlighting these facts in an exceptionally-recealing image from the concept release at 45:

![im](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddf2995c-79a6-4af9-b566-c153c138ad8d)

Over the yeasr, we've come to grerat; appreciate staffs' perpetual diligent efforts to explain these structural nuances to the investing public. I for one would have had to pa many hundreds of htousnads of cdollars in either collegiant expenses or legal feesd to comprehensd infromation made freely avaliable through Commission rule making, intertpreative actions, and public statetements. For these grant efforts by your many teams, I sincerely appreciate the imemense decentralized power of secutiies regualtion through direct acting agents. might the present system of increasingnly singular execution chokepoints for stock trading direclt limit our democracy's abilty top govenr intermediaries? Namely, can we turly oversee an institution so opauqe yet irreplaceable that the select few at its helm decree credit policy so cetnral to market operations?



### Burgeoning Views

In the last ten yeasr, certain blockchain technologies have emmerged through the work of no central solicitor. Indeed commutniies thes,elves both spawn u p[aropund the ] promise of these innovations and actively participate in building their future successful implementations/. This work removeds the need for caentrlaied trust and explictily ovbvciates the function of DTCC and its subsidiaries. In a book proffilign the DTCC at the brink ofthe Great Recession, the corporation's founding CEO wrote:

> I thought throughout these years that as much as I despised monopolies, a DTC monopoly would be benign. Why? After all, monopolies tend to raise fees to customers unduly, let products or services slide in quality and ignore developing services for small customers... All of these developments, along with user desires that DTCC expand its capabilities in order to reduce financial firms' costs and risks, produced a DTCC that is now larger and more complex than the sum of its former parts at the time of their consolidation.
> 
> &mdash; William T. Dentzer, Jr.

More and more , today's investors do not trust in either the DTC or its largest members' solvencies, as will be shown in coming evidence. Should the CCP RTegume face any shortcomings in operational liqudiityh, Cede faces not only the very real prospect of failuing, but also an pre-exisntign central plan for "bankruptcy replacement" by another surviving CCP Rggume.[^tn-hearing-exp] Such coirse of action would emmicerate hundreds of millions of custodail invstmnet accounts.

[^tn-hearing-exp]: See note in OCC link video 16; need a  real primary source on this

To precent this plabtent theft, trhere apprears to me no alterative course of action than the migration of secutiies holdings onto the Stellar network.[^xlm-minimal-info] I would like to submit this point to the COmmission today but make no further technical elaborations in this laetter. In coming to this  ocnsulsuion, I have extensively conteplatedalternives since my forey into web3 resaerch and development eigtht years ago. Four years ago, I began buildign an open-source alternative to the CCP Regume on this bkicjcghaub . This system was materrially ready for public deployment upon the submission of my first letter to the COmmission two years ago, albeit canotically.

[^xlm-minimal-info]: Stellar is one of the few platforms that accounts for liquidity at scale without a centralized party (as associated with traditional Alterneative Trading Systems). We bno onger require thees brokerage middlemne to grease the wheels of markets with regard to the trading of securites held in the Direct Registration System,. Staff can hear more about how the blochcain network takes a crowdsourced approach to liquidity in our commucity discussion of its features, _available at_ https://lnns.co/WJoHIMAXTV4. The SDEX gives all users equal access to a global decentralized order book for any pair of assets on the network. Staff can also investigate A more comperehensive analyusis of this systems implications on market strucutre and general societal imporovements, _available at_ https://wooten.link/thesis. Since its genesis in 2014, the SDEX has processed over 4.6 billion trades worth 27 billion U.S. Dollars.

Some of our most conecntrations ed financial isntuttions will attack this proposed free transaction scheme. They porbabyl have a faeduciaray duty to do so, which is ine. Certain DTC emplyoees stopped speaking to me long ago. Indeed, even my laundry machine is older than the propsed blockchain netwrok. But I've sunk my life intro discoverting the most efficeint system, and I lpan to xplain the logic of this chocice in a nother letter.

## Clear Unsolved Challegnes

Despite best offers from staff throughout an Adminsitration of intense individual investor advocacy, many of our strucutral market problems remain. We applaud the Commision for their exemplary efforts in XYZ_REG_NMS_tick_yya and implementing the unissverasal proxy .[^pers]

[^pers]: I alsop sinceerely apprcaited the tehcincal excellence showcased in the proposition, beta testing, and present impolmenetation of EDGAR Next.

These well-intentioned policies chip away Piecemeal at the larger challenges of a securities indstury operatied on the basis of a single opauqe, concentrate,d and overbearing private corporation. This structure perpetuates a radically-innefficient extracctive system full of coercive risks, compeareted to a decentralided ledger system.

Our market's tabulators should not need multiple differnet methods to remedy the overting orf beneficial share entitlements.[^overvoting-fabrication] These innedicies only exist becuase of the rampant porpogation of clearing Failures to Deliver ("FTDs") since the  1994 amendment of the Uniform Commercial Code ("UCC").[^UCC-year]

[^UCC-year]: While we appreaciet that about half ouf our great Nation's States amended their codes two years ago, and particualty section 8 thereof, tjhese achanges do not address the ametiral concenrs we have over the protection of investor assets held in retiremnt, health-sacings, or any other entitlement accounts. We will detail these challenges later, which were introduced in their entirely in the 1994 amendments.

[^overvoting-fabrication]: : _See, e.g.,_ an internal transfer agent service document descibring six ways to truncate or otherwise throw out votes in elections where more shares are voted than exist, _available at_ https://wooten.link/overvoting-fabrication.

As the COmmission knows, Article 8 of the UCC created these entitlements in 1994, legally seperating investors from what was previously their propery so that brokers could employ them for their own collateral. However, as we'll fund menaingul later, the DTC's lawyers already had States make the requisite custodianshpi opraetional efficincy thchange in 1972.[^BASIC-UCC] Upon an electronic-record modernization update in 1978, the UCC contained all required interemdiary righta and protections tp offer margin accounts and associated hypothecation products.[^FSU-UCC]

[^BASIC-UCC]: _See_ remakrs on the BANKING AND SECURITIES INDUSTRY COMMITTEE amendaments to UCC in 1972, mentioned in the concept release at n.62, enabling the cusotdiahsp and immobalization neccesary for margin loans, _available at_ https://www.sechistorical.org/collection/papers/1980/1984_0401_BasicTeamwork_1.pdf#page=69. Upon the adoption of these new State laws, "DTC commenced taking steps to implement the long-desired broadening of its ownership, even though a small percentage of its eligible issues would be from non-enacting states." As the Commision knows, this ownership stake often exceeds 99.9% of public issuers, presenting an immmense centraliztion risk should its nonimnee partnership face any threats.

[^FSU-UCC]: _See_ Florida State Universit Law Review's article: _A Critical Look at Secured Transactions Under Revised UCC Article 8_, _available at_ https://ir.law.fsu.edu/lr/vol14/iss4/2. In 1987, Dr. Paul B. Rasor, Ph.D. therein states that:
> The extension of article 8 to uncertified shareholder interests did not have anything to do with the problems of secured lenders. Instead, it grew out of the so-called "paperwork crunch" which came to a head in the late 1960's in the securities industry... financial intermediaries and other bailees will presumably have records showing which notices were received when. Nothing in the revised article 8 affects this.

Holy fucking shit they cant have FTDs because "Under revised article 8, there can be only one registered pledge of an uncertificated security at a time." at 883
statue ciattion is note 114

Plainly, there were no FTDs before the 1994 amendments to the UCC.

## Coinbase

I share the Commission's stated public view that Coinbase Global, Inc.[^cb-light] ("Coinbase") presents a brazen overstepping of "well-established principles of the federal securities laws."[^cb-suit-main] It shook me to the bone when I heard Coinbase's chiefl legal coursel say that tehir only licensure was state money transmission reporting at SFVegas 2021.[^title] As a user of this centralized platfomr since 2017, I found enforced polciies and procesdures meaningfully questionable as at least three accounts I control have been uniilaterally shut down or meaningfully restricted ~~in means unseen in traditional financial instutions~~.[^723-basis-date]

[^cb-light]: As the public for-profit corporation exists today with nearly0monoplistic control over American on-ramps to crypto asset products

[^cb-suit-main]: _See_ 23 Civ. 4738 (S.D.N.Y.) ECF No. 1, _available at_ https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-102.pdf.

[^title]: The particular representative may ahve ahad a syntatically-different bt funcallity-similar title. My memory does not fully serve me on this fgranularirty, and I did not format my physical notes in an electronic archive back then. For time I will defer from finding a recording link, but staff can obtain one in reference to recorded seessions now kept in a priorietary data storage system, _available at_ https://structuredfinance.org/resources/sfvegas-2021-sessions-now-available-for-replay. _See also_ decentralization discussion in the same year with particpation from anotehr ATS which has not had its registrations shelved, _available at_ https://youtu.be/DGhZcFbbJik.

[^723-basis-date]: _See_ note 1 in persoanl profiling history, _available at_ https://wooten.link/723.



These instances concern me because I am a law-abidindg American citizen who's gone out of my way to report otherwise pshusoenomyous, unregulated, and profitable on-chain trading venues.[^btc-lev-report] Moreover, the accounts of familiy members I've seen restri ted, all of whom live in similar cirucmstances, by and large came without any advanced warning or corrective action avenues. As someone who's had man links to the financial system permanently severed before,[^jw-debanking] this unilateral , opaque, and coercive central control from coinbase suprised me given their public-facing mission to "increase economic freedom in the world."[^cb-s1]


[^btc-lev-report]: Some of this ctivity was required becuase Coinbase chooses not to submit brokerage-stryle trasnaction reports to the IRS. Others resulted in my previously-communicated use of unregulated exchanges which served as the only point of access avaliable to certain markets. And still many more, including tranactions reported for the Synicate, arose from the nature of decentralized exchanges which cannot effectuate cost-basis or capital-gains reporting to the government given their lack of a financial intermediary.y _See also relevatnl;y_ departing Commissioner Genslaers' pragmatic remaekts on taking a nuanced, practiced, and mature approach to regulating such protocols, _available at_ https://wooten.link/OCC n.46.

[^jw-debanking]: _See, e.g.,_ unexpected accoutn termination at an isntutions larlgely influenced by Coinbase and tis infrastrucutre,, _available at_  https://x.com/JFWooten4/status/1814252066300207611. I have had similar experiences with corporate accounts at Coinbase whereby thy would approve comprehsnievely my business given completely and sfull entity disclosres, only to remove such authoritization as soon as any meanignful tranactions proccesss onchain. This expedrience reminds me of a banking instiutution which found cause to investigate my comrporate account after a tranaction well below the SAR threshold. After I did not answer their phone calls for 48 hours, they closed the account with a signfiicant history operating as the day-to-day treasuy funds for team members. Upon later contacting this instuttions, they told me that the ccacount was closed becuase I "walked into a branch and requested so." This did not occur, so I asked the account representative to check back with their team. Approximateyl two weeks later, we had another call where this employee reaffirmed that I physically closed the account in a local branch. However, this would be impossible becuase I was on holiday in Switzerland at the time of the allefged visit, and this bank did not have any branches in Switzerland. Does the Commission believe transactional oversight should extend so far as to terminate one's ability to partocipate in the financial system just because their phone does not have signal in a gforeign coutnry?

[^cb-s1]: _See_ the intermediary's S-1 direct listing disposing of _115_** million insider shares worth approximately $898e8r in public markets, _available at_ https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000162828021003168/coinbaseglobalincs-1.htm. The filing uses the phrase, "a more fair, accessible, efficient, and transparent financial system" at least three times as gnerally promoting an open netowrk for the world. At 121, thye also tout traditional banking services "from offering compounding rewards on savings that pay out by the second to compensating users for virtually completing tasks through global micropayments."


Around the time Coinbase decided to close odwn its longstanding nonprofit initiative, I helped my partner open a Coinbase account so that she could deposit U.S. dollars onto the Stellar netowrk. The purpose of thes funds was to invest in an asset tradable on a decentralized exchange. When openign the accountm,  we answered all questions indicating such intentions, provded all requested PII, and linked her bank account.

Within ***half a year,***(need cf start date here) it was time to aqsuire the asset I wanted my partner to invest in. The price was ready to break out, so we started depositing funds into the account. Over the course of at least three months, my partner depisited her savings with coinbase to aquire USD Coin and subsreqeuntly withdrawl those tokens onto her blockchain wallet, as establshed offline and intiialize through a hardware security device. These funds originaed in part from her full-time employment and in part from a parental graduation gift upoon her completion of college last year/.

None of these transactions or gidfts in themselves exceeded the SAR thrreshold. The systems worked as expected and transffered dollars into her wallet, which she subsequently used to aquire an asset on the decentralized exchange.

Then, my partner received a bonus from work equivalent to the SAR threshold


Email on Oct 14:
"Coinbase takes several steps to keep your account safe, and we actively monitor for unusual activity and scams that may affect our customers. **Based on this monitoring, we are concerned you may have sent, or are trying to send, crypto to a fraudulent person or platform.** Out of an abundance of caution and to protect you against potential losses, we have temporarily **limited your ability to send additional crypto until November 14, 2024.** This restriction will be removed automatically after the set time period elapses."

Original restriction on Oct 15:
"As a precautionary measure, to protect you against potential loss, we have limited your ability to send crypto until November 14, 2024. Please try again after this date."

Email on Oct 23:
"We have completed your account review, and buy/send/deposit services remain disabled at this time."
This complements the debanking sentiments at [this video](https://youtu.be/WgjUM8U81FY?t=4639).

After submitting KYC for at least the third time, a message on Oct 24, 2024, stated:
"As a precautionary measure, to protect you against potential loss, we have limited your ability to send crypto."

On Nov 29, 2024:
"We are reviewing your account. This process can take up to 3 days."

Still restricted. Attempts at transferring reminiscent digital assets were made on or after Dec 15.


"intermediation failure" part can be laid out without explicit DTCC reference through the other institutions. Will just need to lightly implicate that this is all based on the links commonly underlying the whole framework.




theres one item i'd liek to add in a fn here or in the 144 noaction:

### Key Facts

#### Closure, Inactivity

6 Nov 2024 email: "Login to your account to avoid a $25 inactivity fee" stated, "Our records show that it has been approximately six months since you have logged into your SoFi Investment account(s). **Please log in by end of day 11/15/2024 to avoid a $25 inactivity fee.**"

A $25 fee was charged on 20 Nov 2024, effected by selling 0.1 shares of the account on 21 Nov. The remainder was sold, and the account was closed on 25 Nov.

#### Crypto as Origin

Email dated 6 Dec 2023 indicated, "Crypto services ending soon" and "SoFi will be discontinuing crypto services on December 19, 2023."  

"You have until January 28, 2024, to sell your crypto holdings and close your crypto account."

This resulted in the disposition of Lumens bought at or about the price level on June 17, 2022. They were sold and credited to the broker account on 29 Jan 2024 (~20 x 51).

---

It also offers a stellar place to insert arguments against central intermediation of the transfer process.[^cb] Hopefully, these and additional emotional arguments around the last FOIA in OCC (24-01211-E) and more recently 25-00185-FOIA will push the Commission toward the 501(c)(3)'s side. :)

Recently, indaequate  administrative procedures of an unreliable central broker cost me and my partner $100k in the last couple of months.

*Indeed, we'r eproduced a mountain of pioneering research, actively clarifying meaningufl ownerhsp concepts[^heat-lamp] alobgside the Commission's helpful stewardace. Remarkably, as someone new to the COmmitity these last couple years (conotically), all this action took place with no central coordinator, no compensatedion mechinasm, and no legal offices. We live in a very different time than the days past when our dcurrent systems originated.[^diff-time] Give n the burefonong enciomentmen........ the Commission  belive XYZ more maschiline... now is the time a new and stested system ?

Namel, we have confirmed throuh discussions, conversations ,and by definative website "Q&A sectopm" updates certain operations by a leading transfer agent which allow shares held in a directly-regisreted investpors' name to be swept into agent nominee custodianship without due notice or concent should such investor enroll in an issuer plan, be it directly sehlfed on an S-3 or not volunatarily perpetuated by issuers themselves. While the release does mention this option as a possabilty for known brokered holdings, I find it materially worrison given the declared holding of plan-custodian nominee shares in a DTCC/Cede account at a market bropker for the sake of accessing trading liquidityh,.

Regardne;ss of the risk surrounding SROs, millions of American investors risk the insolvencey of transer agent nominees (or third party administrators, as the case may be). Given the frequent comlex relationshiupos between such custodinas and broker-deadelers, any mishandling of securities lending practices coupld place the most direct form of empower-sponsored reitrement savings in risky hands. Given Wall Street has been known for cdecades to mismark short positions as long,[^recently] do staff believe that nominee admionstrators' model of grabtuibg investors services "at no charge or for a modest fee"[^free-quote] can sustain the bookeeping prudence costs associated with largely Staet-overseen holding compliance?

### Specific UCC Changes from Don Grande



> Allowing massive institutions, many of which are worth hundreds of billions of dollars, to have priority over security entitlements belonging to individual investors creates massive distortions in the marketplace that could ultimately hasten a large economic crash. But even if this were not the case, an important question for policymakers remains: Is a system truly worthy of saving if it would happily sacrifice individual investors’ wealth to save allegedly too-big-to-fail institutions? <!-- TAR2: Securrency "too bigger to fail" extrapolation here -->

they write:
> No. The security entitlement holder does not have rights attaching to particular securities in the pool, he has a _pro rata_ share of the interests in the financial asset held by its securities intermediary to the amount needed to satisfy the aggregate claims of the entitlement holders in that issue.

### 2 things to cover in this PR:

#### central DTCC DA study cited later requisiting control over hte ientire insuty by a single corporation which exists with for-profit stakeholders, either directly ort inderectly
in the former case, we have a public corporation which outted in their S-1 filing (no citation_) that they will "[insert quote on saving the workd crap]... [insert very compelling different quote about makign one billion moniess]"

v the board on DTCC 
I don;t think we touvhed on this yet
perhaps implicate it lightly with idenfitifaiton and name droppping of the selectf few worst offenders thereto
\

#### Chives throughts 

Thanks for starting a place for discussion here John - So interesting to have these large reports come out so close to each other. I'm going to need to work on my note taking and presentation skills, and learn from you!

I hadn't realized that Tether was reportedly so heavily backed by U.S. treasuries. off topic for a moment but it puts me in mind of Japan's markets (which DTCC just partnered with for Launchpad!) and how Japan is largest foreign owner. If Yen drops (ongoing problem) and treasuries end up sold, tether could depeg, which would spiral further as other stablecoin or BTC related backings would lose value too.

"In recent years, institutional sponsorship of Bitcoin (BlackRock ETF, MicroStrategy) has been growing and crypto assets have behaved like “high beta” assets" - (111) MSTR getting direct shoutout here for their approach to investment and growth

"Structural demand for Treasuries may increase as the digital asset market cap grows, both as a hedge against downside price volatility and as an “on-chain” safe-haven asset" (111) - I find this really cute. Report is establishing that fiat, not other value mechanisms which have actual backing, are themselves backing stablecoins -> therefore adoption of tech is going to continue providing home and growth for tbills. I'm not so sure but makes sense the Treasury would express this expectation!

Diagram on 112 is simple and fantastic imo. Doesn't cover custody, but doesn't need to to be appreciated - types of assets and implied claim therein.

I also think the tokenization explainers on 113 are fantastic. "Tokenization has the potential to unlock the benefits of programmable, interoperable ledgers to a wider array of legacy financial assets", graphic to right establishing where relevant data is stored (ideally, a public read blockchain, but similar to DTCC this is unspecified) SIDEBAR- WhyDRS could use articles breaking down tokenization in a similar way, but from a custodial perspective, relating it to a title deed in a safe if holding the private key.

"The benefits of tokenization extend far beyond and are independent of native crypto assets like Bitcoin as well as the public, permissionless blockchain technology those assets have popularized" - (114) spoke too soon. Giving away the game here, aren't they? --> leads into the unified ledger section you highlighted --> must "be developed under auspice of central banks"
"Cybersecurity Threats: Certain types of DLT solutions (public, permissionless blockchains) are vulnerable to hacking and other cybersecurity attacks, which could pose risks to the security of tokenized Treasuries" - (118) maybe in the case specifically of a treasury, issued by a nation state, I could appreciate the point here. Typically public permissionless is my preference.

Under concerns, they include: Increased Complexity and Opacity:
− Tokenization leads to more composability, which could significantly add complexity and opacity to the financial system
from new and non-traditional assets being added to the digital financial ecosystem
− Improperly coded smart contracts can rapidly trigger unwanted financial transactions with unintended consequences
.... which I wish had been a lot more detailed!

Page 120 is borrowed from https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/DASCPWhitePaper.pdf which I don't think I'd read before - some new homework.

Ah! Page 121 is exactly what I might have wanted from the DTCC - an explanation of blockchain structure with attached rationale. The punnet square in the corner is exactly how I've imagined and explained the 4 types of blockchains for years, so pretty cool to see it here. SIDEBAR - I also think we could use a similar page explaining exactly these items on WhyDRS, especially once seeking to have multiple blockchains relevant to not only DAO and settlement day to day but additionally in context of expected private market chains.

Initiated Dec 18, 2024, from CB. Still awaiting KYC.
To WF due to no support for LR via either manual or Plaid as the only option.
Estimated standard 2-day transfer.

On Dec 20, 2024, WF performed an RTP instant transfer to LR.
Placed on hold until Dec 27, 2024.

Received at least three calls from LR and a compliance email mandating a call by Dec 26, 2024, at 3 PM ET:

I agree with the late Visa network founder's theiss that the infrasturcre unedletingh outr markets should not lay in the corruptabel hadns of a select few indsutry intermediareieos.  We;ve seen the further and further onsolidation of DTCC adn its naturasl squashing of transfer-agent innvoation. Now is the time for a new ,m parllel rail avalibale to investors seeking directy cusotdu of their investment seucieritre.s It is my understanding that the present administration made a promise to keep us fortified from Wall Street's "predatory short selling" resulting in the FTD problem.[^RFK-camp]

[^RFK-camp]: _See_ pending cabinet apopitntees' sentiments in prior compainging efforts, _available at_ https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1792970117204287992.

A committment to establish "a free and fair market" with "aggressive Wall Street reforms" based around "greater transparency" could be easimly eimplkmeneted with a blockchain securitiers trading and settlement systme.

As the Commission knows, I am the aslo fouinder of a registerd transfer agent operating using the public open-source blockcvhain system communicated in previous letters. As sahred, I have built this systen iover tge ciyurse of many years of technical analysis, regulatory study, amd Pythonic implkmeentation.[^repos] As the primary contirbutor towards these refforts, I still both retail all shares in teh agent and control the licencing nature of my work.

### Natural Monpoly Rsisk

Accordingly, it's my intention to donate my shares in the company to WhyDRS, presuming that's sometihgni the communti ywould liek to happen. I am still weeding through the legalities and tax iomp[lications ] of this transfer given the treeatment of interest under 26 U.S.C. § 1361(b)(1)(B), _inter alia._ NOtwithstanding, I intend to gifue out the details here in a manner which grants tyhe ASsociation binding and enforcabel control over the company.

Firstly, I would appreacite a reply from staff within 90 days as to  the owenrshipo of a blockchain transfer agent by the DUNA, as such a nnonprofit arranglemtyn mimics existing regualtory-oversight schemes availed of Federal recogniztion. Implications from the Commission's response to this gift could materially assist communtiy members with an analysis of whetehr or not ot accept the shares. Naemly, this combination of euals into a superstructure for public intfrastrucutre quite directly raises the particpatory and reputational bar for our ongoing  social efforts towards efficient markets.

> A free market economy is the only way to efficiently run a society.

> I'm afraid that the markets are becoming overextended, and... a downturn is a very big risk becaue margin balances have been growing very very quickly.

> Bitcoin falls, say, 30, 40, 50 percent from one day to the next. There'd be many bankruptcies. The clearing corps would be unable to pick up the pieces, and... all the bad debt would be transferred to the clearing members.

Similar power track as running validators, which we should introduce on a single-entity basis with triad implications.

^Should include a footnote related to setting a reorganization record so other nations can follow jurisprudence on TAs implementing TAD3 and investors uncovering government roles.

also, I gues it would be irresponsible to not say that "I have unsucesffuly applied for funding from the SDF or its related projects engaging in the dirspebsement of the network's native layert-1 utiltiy token at least three times, and I personally do not particually plan to apply for such financial support again "~~given our pgoress with no outside corporate funding~~

# WF DTC Interactions on a More Institutionalized Side (Notes)

Presumes a transitory framing of collaborating with brokers by positioning as replacing the DTCC and empowering them with a more efficient clearing and settlement system.

### Dad Call

- Received a legal document from WF authorizing signatures with wet signatures.
- Did not require medallions or ID certifications.
- As commonplace in past chats, they rely on obtaining a "[legal] opinion from a big law firm, and if something goes wrong, they just sue the big law firm."

Emailed DTC only.
Did not conduct a call for that offering.
(Implications of past TA email fraud on a 9M wire item.)

Bank DWAC'd it out and can DWAC back to own custody via physical certificate.

"I've been trying to get this done for a week. It's really stressing me out."

Trustee may hold bond proceeds until project milestones.
Interest paid post-bulk fundraising.

# SIPC Intricacies

These can be subverted in a footnote based on leadership actions that "jeopardized the safety, soundness, and stability of the United States financial system" per [H.Res. 1574](https://democrats-financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/bills-118hres1574ih.pdf), as referenced in [this video](https://youtu.be/Cn1ffXT1PS4).

We would greatly appreciate it if the Commission could kindly put this subject up for review in a new proposed rule by the second quarter. (## Careful here)






Recently, my partner hit a cat on her drive home from work.2 Reflecting on the moment, she remarked that she "knew she was supposed to brake" but was in a late-night panic after a hard day. On approach, she swerved to avoid the {black} cat, but unfortunately, it ran in the direction she swerved.

segway to "Just washed my car."

There was a small mud spot on the tire, but I didn't have tire cleaning product. Once I finished, I drove it into the garage + tried to clean it. Even though there was only one dirty area, I had to wipe down the whole tire b/c was too dark to see the blemish.

the Commission introuced the Central Certificate Service ("CCS") in the context of the Unsagre Practics Study ("UPS").[^nyse-intro]

[^nyse-intro]: _See_ concept rlelease at n.45.

The issuer's bankruptcy filings showed a the CCS street-name partnershjip nominee referenced as owning 776,404,408 common shares, _available at_ https://wooten.link/kroll-cede at 8.

Thus, it would be impossible for all partnershipp nominee clamimants to bear rights to a common stock in this enterprise.


might we consider “hitting the brakes” on the markets while we publicly review the full extent of ownership diffusion across the industry? (phrased more diplomatically in reference to the Commission).
Might this approach allow us to uncover the best course of action if an extensive external audit reveals a material commandeering of American investor assets? **at this point we shoul [fn] Dole

/it might be close, but I know this iwll sink the hook in well

Then let's textrapolate this into makign the SRO clearing numbers transparent so that everyone can see the baseliane market data on top of the limited existing FTD and SIP disclosures. This ddraws along the parlalel of seeingthe flooring light past Moozooz's obstruction, which not touching the existing gated systems. So to add to the 3 negotiating fronts we can throw around circular data access, a natural aspect of TAD systm givne investors owuld require access to the smae ownersghip information collabroativesly shared between agents in a cooprartive systme.

Please try to wrap it up with something a little more inspiration from the depths of an equality standpoint .Everything here startd around a radical change in social moneratry and financial system organization with Nixon's depegging, and I want so dearly to convery that sentimetn in savings securities themselves from the same fate . <3
