# Document


Dear Ms. Countryman and Mr. (Chair?) Atkins,

When I was a boy in high school, I began researching the stock market. At the time, I was working a minimum-wage job at Subway every spare weeknight or weekend double. I'd walk about half an hour to and from the store in the latter case when my mom was caught up at work. In the fleeting moments I had between classes and later athletics, I turned all my spare attention to our great investing industry because it promised a way out of the daily servitude.

In just one brief lifetime, we've seen our great nation's market system attract and expand to households from all ends of society. While only the affluent and wealthy might have had access to the securities of a distant physical past, today's most meager investors can trade on a fair playing ground with the same opportunities for growth.[^thf]

[^thf]: Cite Robinhood triplicate from discussion on fractionalized share pushback from industry. I know we all know the truth here, but there isn't a better way to introduce the narrative imo.

Or at least, it's supposed to be a fair equivalency. Because I was only 16 after months of researching the market, brokers wouldn't extend an account under my name. It was these early trades outside my own control that shaped my underlying passion for efficient securities markets. But an investor's portfolio shouldn't be outside of their control. Indeed, I expect quite reasonably that a stock be registered and owned outright in my name when I pay good money to its seller. Do you agree that one's portfolio should be their own property?

Unfortunately, this is not the case of today's market functions, no matter your age. Indeed, it hasn't been the case since the unstructured monopolization of the clearing and settlement market many decades ago, despite both the Commission and Congress' best efforts.[^mon] For decades this reality has narrowly averted public catastrophe.[^lehman] But we can no longer ignore the pressing realities of these systemic idiosyncratic risks.

American States have introduced legislation undermining the conceit and constructions DTCC's agents introduced into the 1994 Universal Commercial Code.[^DTCcs] Quite soon, a select few States reconstitute the right of investors to their own portfolios as a due property law. When this happens, I am extremely concerned with the solvency of Cede & Co. should any number of institutional custodians relocate to such jurisdictions to reap the enhanced protections promised by our shared ideologies.

[^DTCcs]: I want direct quotes here focused by and large on the agent part. The legislative reform should stay in the main argument. https://fmlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Issue-3-Background-paper-on-Article-8-of-the-Uniform-Commercial-Code.pdf#page=8 "security entitlements"

## Organizational Association

I am writing to you on behalf of WhyDRS, a decentralized unincorporated nonprofit association of thousands of individual investors. We are both the first American DUNA and a recently-approved public 501(c)(3) charitable organization. Our Association stemmed largely from the unprecedented shutdown of market operations of 28 Jan 2021.[^cong] Four years later, our great financial system still faces a well-known sweltering threat able to subvert even the most prudent rules set by this great Commission.

[^cong]: Cite the two hearings and the Congressional study with tenor-deep ethos

We sincerely appreciate staff's diligent efforts over the past few years of our collective outreach.[^ncs] Your response to our pressing concerns directly shaped the XYZ growth of our decentralized market of blockchain transfer agents XYZABC.[^gren] We respectfully submit to the Commission that now is the time to take action on the years of work industry innovators have built since the advent of widespread blockchain technologies in the past decade.

[^ncs]: Let's carefully cite a range from the NSCC petition to OCC withdrawal to EDGART modern to things from the other side of the _hall_ with deference to scrutinizing TAR at n/16 (_see Id)

[^gren]: Cite explicitly and prominently the Gensler interview and anything else major, but largely the stemming function which gets set up in _Id's hall circa_



### Educating

Wall Streret stunned our community when theu inlaterally siezed our abiliy to aquisre a public security subject to no restrictions by the COmmissison. FGrom this tschock, our dricivng aND UNWAVIGN objective centereds around understanding the  "Rube Goldberg" machine Congress expects staff to effectively oversee on a daily basis. The gfurther many communtiy members dove into market strucutr,e the more clear it became that its reliance on a single faliable party exposes all investors to signficant risk.

Since these awekenging, we've made every effort tyo hsare and collecitvle yinform the public about the pending collapse of our central clearing countperartyt secutiries transfin and settlemetn rsystem ("CCP Regime"). Namely, the cocnentration of nearly all investment assets into a **limited patrtnership trust** presents unwardable conflicts of interest in the expandsion of collateral lending facilities, be them direct or implicated by operational polcieis. 

This point will become more readily apparant as further evcidnec edocuments in this comment. ONe key public article detailing the centralizty of theis fact existing on our website: "The DTC/Ceding Ownership - Choiuce without a Choice" (itliscs?)./ As the Commission knows, our great American cpaitlist syustem relies on voluntary exchange of goods and services. Issues cannot avail themselves of this basic benefit of free markjets because there exists no competitior to DTCC. In fact, such a proposition has been corecisiley deemed unactionable by some of our nationals leading "To Big to faiul" banks. We sincerely appreacite staff highlighting these facts in an exceptionally-recealing image from the concept release at 45:

![im](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddf2995c-79a6-4af9-b566-c153c138ad8d)

Over the yeasr, we've come to grerat; appreciate staffs' perpetual diligent efforts to explain these structural nuances to the investing public. I for one would have had to pa many hundreds of htousnads of cdollars in either collegiant expenses or legal feesd to comprehensd infromation made freely avaliable through Commission rule making, intertpreative actions, and public statetements. For these grant efforts by your many teams, I sincerely appreciate the imemense decentralized power of secutiies regualtion through direct acting agents. might the present system of increasingnly singular execution chokepoints for stock trading direclt limit our democracy's abilty top govenr intermediaries? Namely, can we turly oversee an institution so opauqe yet irreplaceable that the select few at its helm decree credit policy so cetnral to market operations?



### Burgeoning Views

In the last ten yeasr, certain blockchain technologies have emmerged through the work of no central solicitor. Indeed commutniies thes,elves both spawn u p[aropund the ] promise of these innovations and actively participate in building their future successful implementations/. This work removeds the need for caentrlaied trust and explictily ovbvciates the function of DTCC and its subsidiaries. In a book proffilign the DTCC at the brink ofthe Great Recession, the corporation's founding CEO wrote:

> I thought throughout these years that as much as I despised monopolies, a DTC monopoly would be benign. Why? After all, monopolies tend to raise fees to customers unduly, let products or services slide in quality and ignore developing services for small customers... All of these developments, along with user desires that DTCC expand its capabilities in order to reduce financial firms' costs and risks, produced a DTCC that is now larger and more complex than the sum of its former parts at the time of their consolidation.
> 
> &mdash; William T. Dentzer, Jr.

More and more , today's investors do not trust in either the DTC or its largest members' solvencies, as will be shown in coming evidence. Should the CCP RTegume face any shortcomings in operational liqudiityh, Cede faces not only the very real prospect of failuing, but also an pre-exisntign central plan for "bankruptcy replacement" by another surviving CCP Rggume.[^tn-hearing-exp] Such coirse of action would emmicerate hundreds of millions of custodail invstmnet accounts.

[^tn-hearing-exp]: See note in OCC link video 16; need a  real primary source on this

To precent this plabtent theft, trhere apprears to me no alterative course of action than the migration of secutiies holdings onto the Stellar network.[^xlm-minimal-info] I would like to submit this point to the COmmission today but make no further technical elaborations in this laetter. In coming to this  ocnsulsuion, I have extensively conteplatedalternives since my forey into web3 resaerch and development eigtht years ago. Four years ago, I began buildign an open-source alternative to the CCP Regume on this bkicjcghaub . This system was materrially ready for public deployment upon the submission of my first letter to the COmmission two years ago, albeit canotically.

[^xlm-minimal-info]: Stellar is one of the few platforms that accounts for liquidity at scale without a centralized party (as associated with traditional Alterneative Trading Systems). We bno onger require thees brokerage middlemne to grease the wheels of markets with regard to the trading of securites held in the Direct Registration System,. Staff can hear more about how the blochcain network takes a crowdsourced approach to liquidity in our commucity discussion of its features, _available at_ https://lnns.co/WJoHIMAXTV4. The SDEX gives all users equal access to a global decentralized order book for any pair of assets on the network. Staff can also investigate A more comperehensive analyusis of this systems implications on market strucutre and general societal imporovements, _available at_ https://wooten.link/thesis. Since its genesis in 2014, the SDEX has processed over 4.6 billion trades worth 27 billion U.S. Dollars.

Some of our most conecntrations ed financial isntuttions will attack this proposed free transaction scheme. They porbabyl have a faeduciaray duty to do so, which is ine. Certain DTC emplyoees stopped speaking to me long ago. Indeed, even my laundry machine is older than the propsed blockchain netwrok. But I've sunk my life intro discoverting the most efficeint system, and I lpan to xplain the logic of this chocice in a nother letter.

## Clear Unsolved Challegnes

Despite best offers from staff throughout an Adminsitration of intense individual investor advocacy, many of our strucutral market problems remain. We applaud the Commision for their exemplary efforts in XYZ_REG_NMS_tick_yya and implementing the unissverasal proxy .[^pers]

[^pers]: I alsop sinceerely apprcaited the tehcincal excellence showcased in the proposition, beta testing, and present impolmenetation of EDGAR Next.

These well-intentioned policies chip away Piecemeal at the larger challenges of a securities indstury operatied on the basis of a single opauqe, concentrate,d and overbearing private corporation. This structure perpetuates a radically-innefficient extracctive system full of coercive risks, compeareted to a decentralided ledger system.

Our market's tabulators should not need multiple differnet methods to remedy the overting orf beneficial share entitlements.[^overvoting-fabrication] These innedicies only exist becuase of the rampant porpogation of clearing Failures to Deliver ("FTDs") since the  1994 amendment of the Uniform Commercial Code ("UCC").[^UCC-year]

[^UCC-year]: While we appreaciet that about half ouf our great Nation's States amended their codes two years ago, and particualty section 8 thereof, tjhese achanges do not address the ametiral concenrs we have over the protection of investor assets held in retiremnt, health-sacings, or any other entitlement accounts. We will detail these challenges later, which were introduced in their entirely in the 1994 amendments.

[^overvoting-fabrication]: : _See, e.g.,_ an internal transfer agent service document descibring six ways to truncate or otherwise throw out votes in elections where more shares are voted than exist, _available at_ https://wooten.link/overvoting-fabrication.

As the COmmission knows, Article 8 of the UCC created these entitlements in 1994, legally seperating investors from what was previously their propery so that brokers could employ them for their own collateral. However, as we'll fund menaingul later, the DTC's lawyers already had States make the requisite custodianshpi opraetional efficincy thchange in 1972.[^BASIC-UCC] Upon an electronic-record modernization update in 1978, the UCC contained all required interemdiary righta and protections tp offer margin accounts and associated hypothecation products.[^FSU-UCC]

[^BASIC-UCC]: _See_ remakrs on the BANKING AND SECURITIES INDUSTRY COMMITTEE amendaments to UCC in 1972 to enable the cusotdiahsp and immobalization neccesary for margin loans, _available at_ https://www.sechistorical.org/collection/papers/1980/1984_0401_BasicTeamwork_1.pdf#page=69. Upon the adoption of these new State laws, "DTC commenced taking steps to implement the long-desired broadening of its ownership, even though a small percentage of its eligible issues would be from non-enacting states." As the Commision knows, this ownership stake often exceeds 99.9% of public issuers, presenting an immmense centraliztion risk should its nonimnee partnership face any threats.

[^FSU-UCC]: _See_ Florida State Universit Law Review's article: _A Critical Look at Secured Transactions Under Revised UCC Article 8_, _available at_ https://ir.law.fsu.edu/lr/vol14/iss4/2. In 1987, Dr. Paul B. Rasor, Ph.D. therein states that:
> The extension of article 8 to uncertified shareholder interests did not have anything to do with the problems of secured lenders. Instead, it grew out of the so-called "paperwork crunch" which came to a head in the late 1960's in the securities industry... financial intermediaries and other bailees will presumably have records showing which notices were received when. Nothing in the revised article 8 affects this.

Holy fucking shit they cant have FTDs because "Under revised article 8, there can be only one registered pledge of an uncertificated security at a time." at 883
statue ciattion is note 114

Plainly, there were no FTDs before the 1994 amendments to the UCC.

### Cap One


16 Jan 2025: email
System issue impacting deposits, payments and transfers
"began experiencing a disruption impacting the processing of some deposits, payments and transfers, which is due to a technical issue with one of our service providers.

Implicates the 400k monthly chat from May 2024 (most likely on the 28th without checking calendar) (spanned into June 12)
"Specifically this has delayed processing of some transactions including direct deposits and Early Pay credit for direct deposits, as well as **electronic payments and transfers (ACH)**" [emphasis added]

At least third request to submit ID to "activate crypto transfers" which started as requisite to login despite material existing Roth assets
which of course can't even link to main bank account....


## Series EE Bonds

Adjustment to account letter dated January 6, 2025, stated the savings bond "was redeemed for an incorrect amount."

The actual amount was 40% less, with $100 being redeemed as $59.76.

The account was debited into overdraft due to human error discrepancy. The message was signed "SSS" from the bank's "Centralized Operations."

## Starting Confliction Story

### Key Facts

#### Closure, Inactivity

6 Nov 2024 email: "Login to your account to avoid a $25 inactivity fee" stated, "Our records show that it has been approximately six months since you have logged into your SoFi Investment account(s). **Please log in by end of day 11/15/2024 to avoid a $25 inactivity fee.**"

A $25 fee was charged on 20 Nov 2024, effected by selling 0.1 shares of the account on 21 Nov. The remainder was sold, and the account was closed on 25 Nov.

#### Crypto as Origin

Email dated 6 Dec 2023 indicated, "Crypto services ending soon" and "SoFi will be discontinuing crypto services on December 19, 2023."  

"You have until January 28, 2024, to sell your crypto holdings and close your crypto account."

This resulted in the disposition of Lumens bought at or about the price level on June 17, 2022. They were sold and credited to the broker account on 29 Jan 2024 (~20 x 51).

---

It also offers a stellar place to insert arguments against central intermediation of the transfer process.[^cb] Hopefully, these and additional emotional arguments around the last FOIA in OCC (24-01211-E) and more recently 25-00185-FOIA will push the Commission toward the 501(c)(3)'s side. :)

Recently, indaequate  administrative procedures of an unreliable central broker cost me and my partner $100k in the last couple of months.

### Specific UCC Changes from Don Grande

Firsly we can cite these MF's absolite nothingball of deception:
: _See_ https://wooten.link/ULC-fraud

which starts off with :

> UCC Article 8 gives priority to those lenders who extend secured credit to the clearing corporation to provide the liquidity that might be needed to settle a given day's trades if one of the brokers or banks fails to perform its obligations to deliver securities sold or make payment for securities purchased.

at 2


and then it's a rriavcial extrapolation to FTDs frin tge FOIA data reqest debnuakl

~~the nthey segue to this entitlement crap to support the lendign collateral crap~~

indiivudal margin was already growing rapdidylu and 

These shoudn't need to be direct quoted.

> 1994 UCC Article 8 revision

> The Code Title... varies

> UCC 8-503 and UCC 8-511. 

> 8-503 mentions the 2 exceptions giving certain secured creditors priority over entitlement holders in 8-511 so we strike that reference to 8-511.

> in 8-511 we strike the 2 exceptions (b) and (c).

> We also suggest addressing the jurisdiction/choice of law provisions usually found in 8-110 (and a conforming change to UCC 9-305).

In disuscsing foreigh regualtions which mimic the State banklruprcy prceeding exeptions, _Europmoney_ writote that "brokers can claim ownership of all cash and securities held with them even if the account is not in debt and securities are being held long."[^euromoney-supercess]

[^euromoney-supercess]: _See_ "The unwinding of onlending" at _supra_ note {{euromoney}}. Thereafter, a fund manager with 75% of thier fundamnetally solvent and even profitable positions siezed reported that "The administrator is stating that to the extent Lehman rehypothecated our stocks we may have lost our proprietary interest in them and thus are now general creditors in the bankruptcy. We thought and were told our securities and our cash were segregated and further insured... This is not about regulation, it is about counterparty credit risk."

# Facts of Ethos Inspiration

## Coinbase

Email on Oct 14:
"Coinbase takes several steps to keep your account safe, and we actively monitor for unusual activity and scams that may affect our customers. **Based on this monitoring, we are concerned you may have sent, or are trying to send, crypto to a fraudulent person or platform.** Out of an abundance of caution and to protect you against potential losses, we have temporarily **limited your ability to send additional crypto until November 14, 2024.** This restriction will be removed automatically after the set time period elapses."

Original restriction on Oct 15:
"As a precautionary measure, to protect you against potential loss, we have limited your ability to send crypto until November 14, 2024. Please try again after this date."

Email on Oct 23:
"We have completed your account review, and buy/send/deposit services remain disabled at this time."
This complements the debanking sentiments at [this video](https://youtu.be/WgjUM8U81FY?t=4639).

After submitting KYC for at least the third time, a message on Oct 24, 2024, stated:
"As a precautionary measure, to protect you against potential loss, we have limited your ability to send crypto."

On Nov 29, 2024:
"We are reviewing your account. This process can take up to 3 days."

Still restricted. Attempts at transferring reminiscent digital assets were made on or after Dec 15.

## Bank Transfers

Initiated Dec 18, 2024, from CB. Still awaiting KYC.
To WF due to no support for LR via either manual or Plaid as the only option.
Estimated standard 2-day transfer.

On Dec 20, 2024, WF performed an RTP instant transfer to LR.
Placed on hold until Dec 27, 2024.

Received at least three calls from LR and a compliance email mandating a call by Dec 26, 2024, at 3 PM ET:
"Please give us a call today 12/26 before 3 PM EST," stated in virtual 'secure' webmail at 10:49 AM ET.
"We are reaching out to ask for your help verifying some information."

Similar power track as running validators, which we should introduce on a single-entity basis with triad implications.

^Should include a footnote related to setting a reorganization record so other nations can follow jurisprudence on TAs implementing TAD3 and investors uncovering government roles.

# WF DTC Interactions on a More Institutionalized Side (Notes)

Presumes a transitory framing of collaborating with brokers by positioning as replacing the DTCC and empowering them with a more efficient clearing and settlement system.

### Dad Call

- Received a legal document from WF authorizing signatures with wet signatures.
- Did not require medallions or ID certifications.
- As commonplace in past chats, they rely on obtaining a "[legal] opinion from a big law firm, and if something goes wrong, they just sue the big law firm."

Emailed DTC only.
Did not conduct a call for that offering.
(Implications of past TA email fraud on a 9M wire item.)

Bank DWAC'd it out and can DWAC back to own custody via physical certificate.

"I've been trying to get this done for a week. It's really stressing me out."

Trustee may hold bond proceeds until project milestones.
Interest paid post-bulk fundraising.
