# Document

This was orignally frames around th `./pending/S7-DC-25.md` content, wich provides the full scope of reference material. That said, the departure of Genslar and Appointment of Atkins seems an opportune time to have this content refreshed given the emmergence of a TAD after the publication of the rule. It can also be a stellar  place to insert the arguments against centranl itnermediation of the transfer process.[^cb] Hopefully these and some other emotinoa;l argumetns around the last FOIA in OCC (24-01211-E) and more recently 25-00185-FOIA will push the COmmission over towards the 501c3's side :)

[^cb]: I have and will insert a story of how recent administrative procedures of an unreliable central broker cost me and my partner 100k in these last couple months.

### Few sentences on alternative by means of obviation

- Stellar is one of the very few platforms that accounts for liquidity at scale with no centralized party (as associated with grease in the wheels argument, and implicated larger scale).
- The Stellar network takes a crowdsourced approach to liquidity. Namely, the SDEX gives all users equal access to a global decentralized order book for any pair of assets on he network. Since launching with the genesis of the Stellar network in 2014, the SDEX has processed over 4.6 billion trades worth upwards of $26 billion. [fn]
