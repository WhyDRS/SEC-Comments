# Original main frame

We respectfully submit this collaborative letter with the viewpoint that Satoshi Nakamoto [is dead](https://evanhatch.medium.com/len-sassaman-and-satoshi-e483c85c2b10). We believe that this perspective shapes the industry’s next options given the [sentiments](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2021/07/27/open-access-interoperability-and-the-dtccs-unexpected-path-to-monopoly/) of Dr. Dan Awrey, Esq. and Joshua Macey, Esq.[^industry] Ms. Countryman, given recent [public demand](https://wooten.link/gme) for a new transparent trading and settlement system,[^] we respectfully submit this decentralized framework to restore confidence in our most advanced, developed, and liquid capital market.[^american]

Cannot be Transfer Agent and Broker Dealer, problamatic speeration custody implications
"Netting is a function commonly performed by clearing agencies and may also be performed by broker-dealers for customers holding in street name, but is not among the core functions enumerated in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(25) performed by registered transfer agents."

All agree that (i) DTCC is systemically important and needs bailoit (ii) DTCC is on the brink of bailout per eg, GME but via references to Prev (iii) therefore there needs to be a system in place to replace DTCC so that we arent perpetually bailing out the CCPs, the only such system being blockchain. Make the case for using Stellar, a distributed ledger well-known to innovative...staff.

In response to comments by :
Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke explained that: "[T]he historical record shows that clearinghouse arrangements have generally withstood even severe crises. This solid performance reflects good planning and sound institutional structures but also some degree of good luck, as crises have also revealed important vulnerabilities, vulnerabilities which prompted subsequent reforms by both the private and public sectors." Good luck is not a strategy, so why can I be confident that Treasury clearinghouses [the FICC] will perform even in times of market stress?



On the SRO structure from PREV: extrapolate this to confer presidentail control over the DTC as a de-facto industry requirement to operate in the transfer agent business for public US compnaies

Our rules can serve to increase barriers to entry and entrench large competitors, which leads to market concentration.

We agree with TRES’ poisiton that ""the traasurty market super important yay"". However, we find these recent develop[ments contrary to the public policy objectives trumpteted by recent FTC actions aimed at preventing undue monoplization.[^aapl] More to the point, we respectfully submit to the commission that "DIRECT MONPOLY QUOTE FROM RULE talking about lowering interbank credit risk," while well-intentioned, fails to contemplate the alternative deployment of a debit-based diret investor-to-investor trading sstme using distributed ledger technology.

"We need to end self-regulation in financial services. 

Many law and finance academics have been arguing for an end to this "failed experiment" for a while.

In the US Code, the only industry that has codified self-regulation is financial services... [all other industry groups] are in a sense self-regulated... but it’s not codified. There’s not a law that says they have to [follow SRO rules].^See also notes 16, 21, and 137 in PREV

The problem is self-regulation... The SEC approved what they believed was a rule regarding mandatory buy-ins, which was in fact a rule to eliminate the word mandatory from buy-ins—to make them voluntary. {File No. SR-NYSE-2005-50}

I truly believe we have to get rid of the self-regulatory option in financial services.

{{potential ending quote}} In fact, Bill Denser used to say, "Depository Trust Company: trust is our middle name." If people don’t trust the Depository, then the whole thing falls apart. Which is kind of where we are now, right? We’re at a point where we don’t trust the centralized system. We don’t trust the regulators.

We have corruption in our goverment as much as other couintries have corruption in 

We went through all these machinations 20 years ago, and yet here we are today and people are still asking, "What do you think about naked short selling?" Well, I think failures to deliver are the root of your problem. Why short, when you can fail to deliver?

We heard so much about naked short selling 20 years ago, and then here we are today still talking about naked short selling... even if you borrow the shares to deliver for settlement, then you still have created an IOU—you’ve created a phantom share—in the account of the person who loaned the shares out. {{extra phantom shares floating around}} 

[L]aw and finance academics have been arguing for an end to this "failed experiment" for a while.

### itnroducing DTC
which gets extrapolated to dtcc c&s sys

> The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) is the only stock depository in the United States.  When DTC provides services as the depository for an issuer’s securities, its securities can trade electronically. Without DTC eligibility, it is almost impossible for a company to establish or maintain an active market for its securities.

The spread of blockchains is bad for anyone in the "trust business"—the centralised institutions and bureaucracies, such as banks, clearing houses and government authorities that are deemed sufficiently trustworthy to handle transactions. Even as some banks and governments explore the use of this new technology, others will surely fight it. But given the decline in trust in governments and banks in recent years, a way to create more scrutiny and transparency could be no bad thing.
— _The Economist_

> You’ve all seen _The Big Short_... What went wrong there? It was a lack of transparency in these major mortgage-backed securities frameworks. Well guess what the principle benefit of the blockchain is? A transparent, immutable ledger. We have the solution to that problem.
> You know the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. That crisis, guess what? Has not been fixed. So, it’s over, we got lucky. But in fact, we took—to fix the problem—what was too big to fail, and we turned it into too bigger to fail. The problem is not better. And, in fact, there’s a huge demand for liquidity; many folks expect that there may be a liquidity crisis in the next year or two. The old financial system cannot fix this.
> [Centralized trust] very nearly caused our financial system to come down. It is quite possible that, without a replacement... the next problem is worse. And what was a crisis becomes a collapse.

> Agile is often seen as a chaotic process, but if you've actually engaged in it, it is anything but chaotic; in fact, it determines at every moment what developers should focus on through a rigorous but adaptive process, not willy-nilly. 

> We tend to say, "we've got this well established process that we used over and over and over again," instead of actually engaging our end users in the process. And not proxies for professional program managers or others&mdash;the actual end users in whatever it is that we are looking to do. If you get the end users involved, it does away with the need for a lot of process. 

> Responding to change over following a plan: this is the thing that I fight [for]&mdash;on daily basis&mdash;against the bureaucracy. The bureaucracy loves a plan... [the buraucracy believes] we've got to stick to it. Being systematically able to adapt is where you become innovative, and it's where we become efficient as an Agile organization.

> The PoC focused on modelling how margin calls and their associated processes could be automated, made more efficient and transparent for all participants using digital assets and smart contracts – or rules that automatically execute on a distributed ledger when certain conditions are met.

it is precisely these technologies which obviate the need for the DTCC.
harp on the requisite disclosure of marigning algorthms and such as consistent with requests of PREV
then spin that b/c obs these mfs aren't going to do that in any  meaningful capacity as prospected in their walled gardens

> In the case of clients maintaining segregated accounts with their Clearing Member (Client B in the diagram), the JSCC node could directly calculate the portion of the margin call due from the specific buy-side client.

### potential option
use this as an intro to the ckusterfuck of segregated omnibus account resolution and minupulations thereunder, manipulations which are entirely amelierated when investors themselves hold chain-native assets in their wallets. as in how bitcoin was supposed to be. if we can sincereavly voice [such support](https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-fink-bitcoin-bombshell-q3-earnings-call) for these technologies, then might we additionally requisite in a legislative underdone the operational; implications of decentralized direct registration?

these mf'ers are literally using fucking aws at 5. antithical to web3 (okay we need to use words other than antithical, preferailbly that legal jargon version `inimical`)

need to frame this in both the context of protecting the just 3 goals and institutionalized innovation charades[^convo-dtcc]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf439dcd-a461-40d8-89c3-1cc5f12e1994)

this does not look safe

they _compare_ with teh existing system as something that:

> "Especially in the listed derivatives market, the unique and complex structure of ‘omnibus’
> accounts presents challenges for ecosystem design. Buy-side client data, housed within omnibus accounts, is
> managed by individual sell-side clearing members and remains hidden from the CCP. This results in a complex
> market structure with a hierarchy exceeding three layers."

can use this carefully as framing, likely elsewhere

they trhen pose the "solution" that (removing the jargon sensences with no active tense or meaning) posits:

> JSCC created a tiered application structure allowing sell-side entities
> to manage their own omnibus accounts through a UI. However, in this setup, the network owner (the CCP in the
> POC) had access to all data.

look i can't decode their complete misinterpetation of the chain of custody when managing digital wallets, but let's perhaps contemplate how this might afflict centralized interfacing implications 🤔

## Question 166
> Do commenters believe the introduction of certain alternatives to the current central securities depository model, such as a modified transfer agent depository, could be beneficial to issuers, securityholders, and/or the National C&S System? Why or why not? Could it co-exist with the current central depository system? Why or why not? What would such a modified depository entail or look like?

Real problem with the centralization of capital, specifically in SPVs investing in private companies which allow these firms to raise signficiacnt funds from the investing public without requiring registration on Form 10 under the number of shareholders prong, as other commenters have pointed out. Argument ot follow: MUST classify beneficial owners as shareholders since they are the ones actually benefitting from the increased corporate disclosures. Cite examples in Reg A singe entity or "pre-IPO" leading to lack of disclosures and centralized gatekeepiong of top investment opportuntiies, only passing off to hte public once signficantly matured.

We respectfully submit to the Commission that we do not need to immediately start “dismantling the indirect holding system, in favor of TAD or any other new approach,” but rather we should just give investors themselves the option of expressing their preffered holding method with, though a system such as TAD3, secondary market tools like those avaliable through the intermediated NMS, tools which are possible directly on the blockchain and solve the unfortunate material issuer plan operational efficiency issues in 80 Fed.

## Increased Risk of Broker Insolvencies

Rise of new retail brokers offering commission-free trading

Based on PFOF, but there are an increasing number of investors learning about the true hidden costs of PFOF

These investors are not happy with their brokers and actviely seek brokers without PFOF

These investors are also some of the most sophistocated individual investors ever seen

Leads to a decreased use of non-value-add advisory servioces (most broker advising) and self-diverected investment strategeis (e.g. Index fund investing)
Therefore, brokers without commissions and may find a lack of material fees from advisory services

Given that a number of these brokers offering quality trading and investing services to individuals also provide realtively high interest rates on cash deposits, there has been a general decline in recent broekr profits (???)

Cite study here from public broker annual reports and general profitability

Leading to merger of TD and Scwab 

Consolidation as only way to remain profitable in business

Given all these factors, it seems likely that a cyclical market drawdown  may lead to certain broker insolvencies

Bankruptcies are a problem because of security entitlesments and their tradtment under UCC article 8 in bankruptcy proceedings

Elaborate more and example theoretical potentiatiolly

Also problem with inability for creditors to directly access investor collateral assets without going through interrmeiary (???)

As shown in recent market events where a certain broker was unable to meet increased NSCC capital requirements, brokers may have solvency challenges in the coming years.

Given the increased adoption of individual investors generated lower fees, the decreased holdings of certain institutional investors generating higher fee incoime,[^profits] and the increasing awareness of negative externalities in our current market infrastructure which introduce material hidden investing costs, we respectfully submit to the Commission that broker insolvencies exceeding SIPC coverage or reserves for individual accounts are more likely now than ever before, largerly due to extreme indsutry consolidation into a number of innovative but risky enterprises.[^entrant] Therefore, we want to ensure everyday investors maintain their portfolios in the case of broker bankruptcies. However, U.C.C. Article 8’s present security entitlement reguime seems particalulty against this objective, as creditors to the broker receipt investor securities for the repayment of obligations before investors receive fully-paid and non-assessable assets.[^titling]

[^profits]: due in part to increased retail participation. Cite something here with the Melvin bankruptcy and other additional trends in institutional prime broker services (see ppublic reports of declining broker reveneu
[^entrant]: Talk here about a history of risk and lack of capital... cite hard data
[^titling]: Something about how the inestors think they own if not already established enough, taken away in this case

Transfer Agent Depository and Further Considerations
We see the problem in the broker industry in that broekrs only charge fees to investors[^fees]

[^[fees]: Outside of relatively minor revenues generated from billing for proxy materials distributions.

Some trading institutions require Demat accounts. Access to a dematerialized account requires an internet password and a transaction password. 
The National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) introduced the concept of Demat accounts in 1996. 



Demat accounts are designed to offer more security and speed to financial trades. They can help to:
- Reduce the risk of loss or forgery
- Eliminate theft, forgery, loss, and damage of physical certificates
- Allow for immediate transfers of securities
- Offer the most accurate form of record keeping 



Although brokers presently subsidize their services with material revenues from securities lending, which are gneerally not shared or not materially shared with investors
Risk of decrease of securities lending revenue should the Commission take increased action in decreasing FTDs
Would decrease the ability of certain market participants to lend out securities not actually held on deposit[^F3]

[^F3]: Cite the case of the people that had the “generate secuirtes” button. Other studies where they charge fees without actually locating the securities for borrow per page 32 at www.sec.gov/comments/s7-32-10/s73210-20109778-264121.pdf#page=32

### TAD3

To explain how we presently envision the role of TAD3 in the context of a global capital market, per Section III of PREV, we respectfully submit to the Commission another parallell. Although this reprersentative infrastructure comparison involves illicit activities, we respectfully submit to the Commission that it may exemplify the role of distributed systems in “Web 3.” Alongside this analogy, we respectfully submit to the Commission that, in accordance with note XXXX (US PATENT REVIEW NOT) in PREV, we take money laundering and terrorist financing seriously throughout the design, implimentation, and expansion of TAD3, as further evidenced by our publilc-facing user policies, agreements, and practices avaliable for review on our website.

Tornado Cash was XYZ... Introduce lawsuits and such for frontend operators.

Syndicate SRO members participants are like frontends operators for Tornado Cash. Authenticated users can trade on the go directly with other investors by means of atomic swaps through BlockTrans Syndicate’s investor app. However, as noted in Sectoion III.2.a (???) of PREV, there are certain activites which under the present regulatory regime require the use of a custodian of sorts since transfer agents cannot current perform transactions on behalf of investors, by our present understanding of staff transfer agent guidance, regulations, and non-action letters. An example of such a transaction is performing a dividend reinvestment purchase.[^reinvest] **[[←]] Maybe other examples**

Maybe have a footnote around the Tornado cash info 
[^reinvest]: There may be benefits to investors, market efficiency, and capital formation should an exemption for this routine activity be written into SEC rules. While there are stringent order execution rules for a brokers, we respectfully submit to the Commission that a reasonable set of rules for transfer agents to aquire securities in connection with such a routine pre-planned  (PICK A BETTER WORD FOR THAT) transaction may increase the ease by which issuers raise capital through shelf registrations, the rate at which investors compound their retirement savings, and the adoption of self-directed investing, as less repetative manual tasks may increase the ease by wihch users participate on our most developed, andvanced, and liquid capital market.


Extend to modifying (respectfully suggest etc) Rule 10b–18 to allow issuers to purchase securities from private investors, without going through a single broker dealer per day, so long as the price is at the current secondary market last trading price. Could be some kind of like variation implications. Main point is talking about reducing risking volatility, since you could do that through a single block transaction, without the costs undue burden of brokerage connections - - - on the assumption that the seller of such securities quote ( or sellers ) is neither solicited by the issuer nor its agents

Accordingly, broker-dealers regulated by the Commission as such may become members of the Syndicate SRO so as to effectuate transactions on the books of issuers, rather than through the costly DTCC system.

DTCC’s Unexpected Path to Monopoly by Dan Awrey and Joshua Macey at Cornell Law School.
[[water street comment from there, bailout info from occ sro]]

Although the DTCC moved most to New Jersey last year, the poiint stands that effectively all our present market challenges stem from the DTCC. Unfortunately, due to antiquated DTCC systems and the centralized custodiashgip its operational policies enable, we now face an exocential crisis of innacurate accouintiong throughout the market. These flaws generally propogate at the expense of everyday investors and to the benefit of big banks, brokers, and custodians. 
	We can point fingers all day about how we got to this point over the past number of decades. But the crux of the matter is that, one way or another, there are presently more shares held by investors than ever issued by underlying companies in a number of cases. We will defer citations for this claim to the WhyDRS.org Information Packet previously communicated to Commissioner Gary Genslar, as we believe the diligent, educated, and prudent staff are materially famiar with the widespread continued precedence of failures to deliver enabled by the DTCC despite Regulation SHO.
	We respectfully submit to the Commission that the DTCC; owned communaly by banks, brokers, and certain private interests; maintains material conflicts of interest with investors and issues, promoting and sustaining an overly-intermediated system of securities ownership, trading, and communications.
In this comment and overall agenda regime, we focus on the clear problems of proxy plumbing, , and failures to deliver. We respectfully submit to the COmmission a number of solutions comprehensively solving these predicaments through the Direct Registration System.

WHY TRANSFER AGENT DEPOSITORY BETTER
We understand that the Commission has been contemplating mateiral amendments to transfer agent regulation for a number of years. However, commentors have rightyfully raised the issue that a number of smaller transfer agents serving the needs of small businesses may well be pushed out of the market should their compliance costs increase. Over the past few decadeds, these commentors have rightfully pointed out that, when it comes to modifying transfer agent regulation, the Commission must consider the increased risk to investors should an issuer not be able to afford a transfer agent.

Very rresptcfully ask the Commsission to ADD TRANSFER AGENT TO SRO OPTIONS and explain as per present innovation and the space and due to the number of industry-specefic needs for internal rules. Moreover, our decreased cost of operations due to DLT allows us to continue servicing small businesses even if they fail to make regualr service payments, as has been the case with our first client. Per PREV n.6

We repsectfully submit to the Commission that our continued servicing of these presently XXXXXX investors represents a material benefit to our securities market and the growing number of American small businesses at large. IDK MORE STUFF HERE. Thus, we respectfully submit to the Commsission that it may best protect investors; promote fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and faciliate small business capital formation should staff elect to allow for transfer agent SROs in the case of transfer agent depositories in accordance with note XXXX in PREV.


TAD3 Ecosystem Self Regulation
Should the Commission deem it to be in the best interest of international investors, regulatorsd, and issuers, we would like to respectfully submit the following guidelines for a BlockTrans Syndicate SRO.
We submit that TAD3 may be best understood through a prarallel with Indian securities markets, which have more recently evolved without the undue infliencce of central counterparty clearing houses. We respectfully submit to the Commission that TAD3 is like the demat system. In case staff are not familiar, here is a brief overview of demat, developed by the Indian government:



dematerialization, and is the process of converting physical certificates into electronic form. Demat accounts are digital vaults for stock investments, and are used to store shares, exchange-traded funds, bonds, and mutual funds.

However, CCPs only emerged in the 19th century because of fundmanetal challenges in debit-ased securities transfers. Namely, such middlemen would not be necessary if it weren’t for the countrerparty risk introduced by early market structures, which are prevalent today.#

# socializing loss

This or a direct bailout backstop onto SPIC etc, but not equitable or likely due to recet FULL SVB bailout

FTDs as zero sum - “fraud leaves a trail; and its purpose is revealed in the other book because the value taken from that book must also have come from somewhere.” from https://iang.org/papers/triple_entry.html 

But extyaposted in rehypothecation

if the exchange ends up with a position that has an unrealised loss greater than its insurance fund, then the exchange is effectively bankrupt. At that point, it needs to find a way to cover this loss. One option is for the exchange to add more money to the insurance fund. In theory this is fine, but obviously it has its limitations and if the loss is too large, then it may not even be possible.
The other option, is to use the fact that all the money in the system is zero-sum and therefore the profit from the loss that the exchange holds is still “in” the system. After all, someone else (or multiple people) must be holding a same sized profit from the exchange’s loss.
