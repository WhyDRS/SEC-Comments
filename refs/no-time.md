- Less reuglation and standalone while "considering any negative procyclical effects and impacts to the stability of the broader financial system." Implies if anybody stopped the music then they would figure it all out. At 2.
- States that RWP insovlencey and defualt testing can "involve confidential and highly sensitive information that could make inclusion of clearing members and other stakeholders inappropriate." suggests the process (i) can be games or (ii) exists only in human heads. I lean towards latter. At 4.
- Asks not to notify the Commission when considerign insolvency and faiure of the financial system at 5.

# Fn! Commissioner Gensler moinoply privatization reform note

Robert A. F. Reisner

"Reisner drew up a privatization plan referred to as ‚Äúthe endgame strategy.‚Äù Reisner began talking to Gary Gensler, the Treasury Department's undersecretary for domestic finance, about how it might work. In 2000, Henderson and Reisner met with Elaine Kamarck, a senior staff member in the Clinton administration. Kamarck listened as Reisner talked about the USPS's challenges and raised the possibility of privatization. Then she reminded them that Vice President Al Gore was running for president. ‚ÄúWell, we would have to ask our union friends,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou know, they are critical to the upcoming campaign.‚Äù Soon after, Gensler called Reisner and told him there would be no more discussions about privatization. ‚ÄúWe're putting this on the back burner,‚Äù Gensler said.

It was always clear to Henderson that the postal workers' union had more political influence with the Clinton White House than he did."

Simply changing how shares are held from beneficially owned to directly registered automatically increases how much of the Company you own.  This is true for any Company where shareholders may suspect the DTC has more shares on their books than they should.  Any shareholder that suspects naked shorting is an issue (e.g., üéÆ) would be similarly incentivized to own a bigger portion of the Company by simply Direct Registering Shares.  

Except the DTC hasn't been telling people how many beneficial interests are out there. So it's actually worse than that for Beneficial Shareholders... the SEC says that each participant or pledgee (i.e., beneficial shareholder) having an interest in securities credited to their account has a pro rata interest in the securities of that issue held by the DTC. All the beneficially owned shares held by beneficial shareholders split the pie held by the DTC.
