## 1971 SEC Unsafe 3 Notes (Broker Bad Practices)

"It has published for comment proposals to increase capital requirements for entry into the business and to require a more conservative level of liquidity during- the first year of a new firm's operation. It has proposed rules requirmg the protection of customers' credit balances and securities. It is working on measures to establish adequate operational and financial controls respecting per- sons desiring to enter the business. And it has proposed a set of rules which would require broker-dealers to furnish customers with periodic reports on their financial and operational condition."



"Although the ordinary business can continue to operate despite financial problems. until it becomes insolvent or its liabilities exceed its assets, it has long been recognized that the customers of brokerage firms need to be protected by the application of higher fiscal standards. Pursuant to Congressional  authority. the Commision in 1944 made effetive a net crupital ratio rule the purpose of which WWfl to ensure that a broker had enough liquid capital to meet the ordinary needs of his business, and that he would be shut down, if in trouble, at a time when he would still have enough assets to cover the claims of his customers."



"Where customers' fuuds aud securities were eudaugered, we had ready the necessary court pleadings wllere major firms were involved so that we could go into court promptly if the Exchange did not take adequate action to protect customers' funds and securities. On occasion we pressed the Exchange to commit its Special Trust Fund in various situations, and we went into court to protect the investors in those cases (First Devonshire, Robinsou, and. Plohn) where the Exchange did not do so.

We should also mention the unusually large volume of complaints which our staff has processed during the past three years. With extremely limited resources we have helped tens of thousands of customers straighten out their accounts, obtain delivery of certificates, recover unpaid dividends and interest, etc. unfortunately, we were unable to be as helpful as we would have liked to be to complainants who were customers of firms now in liquidation, where the delivery out of credit balances and securities were governed by court rules."

## bailout secondaries 1 Aug 2024

"Viewed in this light, our more fundamental insight is that the SEC’s open access and interoperability requirements have contributed to a lack of substitutability, thus leaving regulators with few options other than public ownership or a taxpayer-funded bailout should NSCC and DTC ever find themselves on the brink of failure."



See _Monopoly and the Incentive To Innovate When Adoption Involves Switchover Disruptions_

2012



“...incumbents often acquire potential competitors for the sole purpose of heading off competition. These so-called “killer acquisitions” involve the strategic purchase of upstart firms in order to discontinue the competitor’s operations: preventing these nascent competitors from bringing their products to market and, thus, protecting the incumbent firm’s market share."

"we have come dangerously close to the collapse of the entire system"

"non-default losses could therefore wipe out the capital of the CCP and lead it to insolvency"

"the CCP rule book means it can effectively wind itself up without bankruptcy. The latter stages of that waterfall process could be systemically very damaging in the allocation of losses across the wider financial system"

"financial markets could disappear if we lose effective clearing services"

"the CCP service needs to be kept operating and the transmission of stress needs to be kept to a minimum"

"CCP capital is generally pretty small relative to the size of their operations"

“The first and this is a key issue for us is the question of incentives because our CCP equity is not going to be written down. In the case of default losses, do CCPs really have the right incentives to risk manage properly, particularly when they're in competition as many are internationally with other CCPs? And a point that's raised by the private sector is whether the allocation of losses between members on the one hand and CCP owners on the other is unfair because it's very little CCP skin in the game when the losses are mutualized."

"I think we're going to be in a pretty heavy systemic crisis... a reservoir of pre-funded resources that can be accessed only in resolution might be necessary to enable CCP clearing service to continue to operate."

"When you talk to the clearing members at very senior levels, they say they're worried about the risk in CCPs and the fact that they are exposed to these risks, both the neutralized default and the non-default. And they don't have kind of enough influence on the CCPs.” [segway to particpant member lack fo control through delegation structure not generally accepter as per FINRA lawsuit with Alpine Securities]

"These are basically global infrastructures and we need to manage this."

---JON CUNLIFFE, Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, Bank of England



"It strikes me that with a CCP, you have almost no time to intervene and try to take control of the situation, keep it from deteriorating quickly."

— RICHARD J. HERRING, Co-Director, The Wharton Financial Institutions Center and Professor of Finance, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania





"So we don't have the framework on the nonbank side including the CCPs that we've built on the banking side. We have the benefit of now having a framework and an example to learn from and apply. But frankly, we have a lot of work to do in the United States with our counterpart agencies to try to as best we can the Fed, the SEC, the CFTC to try to collaborate in the absence of additional statutory authority as well as on the international side to try to build stronger cross border relationships."

"We don't have the framework, the infrastructure in place on the nonbank side... I think looking at the post-crisis world, this is probably where our attention and priority needs to be."

---MARTIN J. GRUENBERG, Director, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Acting Chairman

they are shielded from removal by the SEC except for cause. 15 U.S.C. § 78s(h)(4).

And the Supreme Court has assumed that the President may not remove SEC Commissioners at will. Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, 561 U.S. 477, 487 (2010). That means that there are two layers of removal protection—one for the Commissioners and one for the hearing officers. That may well infringe on the President’s “ability to execute the laws . . . by holding his subordinates accountable for their conduct.” Id. at 496.

While we can appreciate that Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238 (1936), mining was inherently a local activity, and any effect on interstate commerce was indirect. Therefore case failed, regulation of mining fell under the jurisdiction of the states, not the federal government. However, securities are implictly not only interstate but also increasingly international.[footnote on ICOs; move to direction of global regulatory body

Rather, the legislation must specify sufficient standards and guidelines, delineating clear policies and objectives {per Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 U.S. 381 (1940)}


### SROs Are Not Working

American investors like myself are extremely dissatisfied with the present SRO disclosure, enforcement, and transparency standards.^

^ See, e.g., [shorting information](we_the_investors_massive_FTD_comments), [trade 385](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dz57am/trade_385_the_most_important_ignored_aspect_of/), and [custody secrets](flaming_torch_on_Cede_numbers_over_140%_gme).



"In 1817, the NYSE’s Constitution was adopted and the NYSE subsequently adopted a range of rules governing its members and.. while Congress and the Commission have criticized and modified the SRO system in the past, it has not been radically revised or dismantled since its establishment.” -https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/concept/34-50700.pdf

same, Sec. IV.A.1: "even where an SRO structure may appear sound, successful self-regulation relies on sufficiently vigorous rule enforcement against members on the part of the SRO. If regulatory staff is disinclined to regulate members, selfregulation will fail. Thus, to be effective, an SRO must be structured in such a way that regulatory staff is unencumbered by inappropriate business pressure."

note 75, tie directly to Article 8 concerns: "Under Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, the rules of a national securities exchange must not be designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers."

note 96 the oversight becomes for-profit

Initially, OSTK/Beyond was a majority owner, holding both direct and indirect stakes through its blockchain venture fund, **Medici Ventures**. After tZERO's funding round, Overstock maintained about 55% ownership, with 29% being a direct minority stake.



Additionally, **Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)**, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, made a strategic investment in tZERO in 2022. This investment makes ICE a significant minority shareholder.



Public online bulk retailer, Medici Ventures, and ICE are the primary stakeholders, along with other venture partners involved in its funding efforts

## 1988 Market Break 16 Jan 2024

"The interdependency of the world's securities markets was never more apparent than during the market break. The Commission staff's findings indicate that the major world markets responded quickly and dramatically to movements in other major world markets and that, for the most part, U.S. markets led foreign markets."



“...some market makers were not answering their telephones and that locked and crossed markets were not uncommon."


## ILF Indirect Holdings -- own letter (15 May 2024)

SEC Follow on letter opening quote:

“To grasp the overall effect of a securities settlement design, the SEC should include and evaluate all costs and the efficiency of all stages of a transaction, not only those that are generated at the tip of the custodial pyramid. Indeed, during its entire history the SEC has consistently displayed a strong willingness to serve small investors and the society at large. Why then, do issuers still cede their shareholders to intermediaries although this is unnecessary for an efficient system of securities settlement? Why do intermediaries earn fees on services that are necessitated by their very involvement in the process? Why does a structural inefficiency exist that it large enough to host an entire industry of proxy distribution services[?]"

"Suppose that the U.S. Postal Service announced a super efficient method for delivering mail to New York City: they bundle the mail up as it arrives from hubs in the South, West and North, pin it down with a sturdy net onto a large, wood pallet, and drop it by parachute into Central Park, which reduces their distribution costs by 99.9%. Is this efficient mail delivery? The mail indeed arrives in New York this way, but it still has to be unbundled and delivered by someone (whose costs in this example are not on the USPS balance sheet). If a DRS based on register/accounts for each listed issuer did not allow as high a volume of transactions to be netted as currently is the case, it would nevertheless offer the consolation that once the entry on the register/account was effected, the ultimate buyer or seller would be served. **No partial rights would have to then be unbundled and passed along chains of intermediaries downstream to the beneficial owners.** Centralized netting, while generating impressive numbers like the elimination of 98% percent of transactions, can in effect result in delivering complex bundles to downstream entities, which have to unbundle the transactions and complete the work connected with sale or purchase."



"Central security depositories (CSDs) like DTC are advantageous for lending programs because they hold large amounts of a given class of securities and thus form a liquid pool for share loans.340 Thus share lending is a profitable service that CSDs can offer. In recent years some discussion has been dedicated to the problem of "empty" voting by persons who borrow shares in which they have no economic interest, and proposals have been made to expand the various schedules filed under § 13 Exchange Act to create information on share lending.341 Like information for shareholder communications, information on share lending can be best captured at the source, and a register/account that records changes in ownership simultaneous to changes of record shareholders would be such a source. Thus, depending on how the loan were structured, a TAD system might well be able to provide the kind of information necessary to avoid "empty" voting. However, by moving the information out of the intermediaries it could also move the fees out of the intermediaries.” (original emphasis)

Immediately following: "A register/account would be a good place for share lending because it would contain all the shares of a given class. One could even imagine shareholders agreeing in the issuer's certificate of incorporation to terms and condition of a share lending program to which they could opt in if they wanted to earn extra income from their shares. **This way, lending would not only be transparent, but the profitability of lending would go to individual shareholders rather than having a large portion of it being spread throughout various intermediaries.**"

More relevant later on: 

"The structure was chosen in an emergency situation, and the fact that it generates heavy externalities was accepted because no other alternative was in sight. Now that almost all states permit uncertificated securities, custody accounts are no longer necessary to create the effect of a faux dematerialization. Now that fiber optic networks can send proprietary financial information with high security at the speed of light, it is no longer necessary that registration of transfers be avoided by placing America's shares in the name of Cede & Co. and flushing transaction costs downstream to others. "

## BASIC SEC Report Quotes 28 Dec 2023

> The time for development of the system would probably be longer than if CCS [now DTC] were made more comprehensive by broadening its list of participants to include the entire financial community.


> BASIC had concluded that the comprehensive securities depository system was the route to follow. "Comprehensive" meant that the securities of all segments of a financial community should be in one depository, rather than segregated.
