### DTCC re sro rulemaking

Intro commenting on very good yay previous exective regulatory flexabiulity agenda items, actions, and impact

~~!Federal Preemption of Challenges in U.C.C. Article 8 (UCC 8 Review & Transfer Agent SRO) ~~

Do not think it requires a material change in regulatoryu framework given the thoughtful existing regulations on alternative seurities intermediaries. Rather htan rewiritng the rules or a “drastic overhall of the entire system” as others[^1]

[^1]: See, e.g., Daniel Thieke in Section IV.B of www.sec.gov/comments/s7-27-15/s72715-32.pdf. We respectfully submit to the Commission that we do not need to immediately start “dismantling the indirect holding system, in favor of TAD or any other new approach,” but rather we should just give investors themselves the option of expressing their preffered holding method with, though a system such as TAD3, secondary market tools like those avaliable through the intermediated NMS, tools which are possible directly on the blockchain and solve the unfortunate material issuer plan operational efficiency issues in 80 Fed. Reg.81947 § VII.E, manifesting into ongoing challenges such as bullet 18 of Investor Bulletin: Holding Your Securities (rev. 12 Jul 2023), page 3 from Dr. James Angel in www.sec.gov/comments/s7-12-14/s71214-4.pdf , and risks from interconnectedness between different institutions and international markets in www.theocc.com/risk-management/cross-margin-programs.
We respectfully submit to the Commission investors wnat direct pla etc not ideal Heat Lamp? We want to compete, please let us!
Ultimately, additional support for the TAD system can be readily observed in the growing number of DRS advocates amongst the investing public, material support for the widespread adoption of DRS in comments such as www.sec.gov/comments/s7-05-22/s70522-20120580-272764.pdf, and an ongoing public outcry for quality realtime data regarding recent market incidents, without a Bloomberg subscription, given increasing volatility in just the last week

#### Increased Risk of Broker Insolvencies
Rise of new retail brokers offering commission-free trading
Based on PFOF, but there are an increasing number of investors learning about the true hidden costs of PFOF
These investors are not happy with their brokers and actviely seek brokers without PFOF
These investors are also some of the most sophistocated individual investors ever seen
Leads to a decreased use of non-value-add advisory servioces (most broker advising) and self-diverected investment strategeis (e.g. Index fund investing)
Therefore, brokers without commissions and may find a lack of material fees from advisory services
Given that a number of these brokers offering quality trading and investing services to individuals also provide realtively high interest rates on cash deposits, there has been a general decline in recent broekr profits (???)
Cite study here from public broker annual reports and general profitability
Leading to merger of TD and Scwab 
Consolidation as only way to remain profitable in business
Given all these factors, it seems likely that a cyclical market drawdown  may lead to certain broker insolvencies
Bankruptcies are a problem because of security entitlesments and their tradtment under UCC article 8 in bankruptcy proceedings
Elaborate more and example theoretical potentiatiolly
Also problem with inability for creditors to directly access investor collateral assets without going through interrmeiary (???)
As shown in recent market events where a certain broker was unable to meet increased NSCC capital requirements, brokers may have solvency challenges in the coming years.
Given the increased adoption of individual investors generated lower fees, the decreased holdings of certain institutional investors generating higher fee incoime,[^1]

[^1]: due in part to increased retail participation. Cite something here with the Melvin bankruptcy and other additional trends in institutional prime broker services (see ppublic reports of declining broker reveneu

and the increasing awareness of negative externalities in our current market infrastructure which introduce material hidden investing costs, we respectfully submit to the Commission that broker insolvencies exceeding SIPC coverage or reserves for individual accounts are more likely now than ever before, largerly due to extreme indsutry consolidation into a number of innovative but risky enterprises.[^1]

[^1]: Talk here about a history of risk and lack of capital... cite hard data

Therefore, we want to ensure everyday investors maintain their portfolios in the case of broker bankruptcies. However, U.C.C. Article 8’s present security entitlement reguime seems particalulty against this objective, as creditors to the broker receipt investor securities for the repayment of obligations before investors receive fully-paid and non-assessable assets.[^1]

[^1]: Something about how the inestors think they own if not already established enough, taken away in this case

Transfer Agent Depository and Further Considerations
We see the problem in the broker industry in that broekrs only charge fees to investors[^1]

[^1]: Outside of relatively minor revenues generated from billing for proxy materials distributions


"""
Some trading institutions require Demat accounts. Access to a dematerialized account requires an internet password and a transaction password. 
The National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) introduced the concept of Demat accounts in 1996. 



Demat accounts are designed to offer more security and speed to financial trades. They can help to:
Reduce the risk of loss or forgery
Eliminate theft, forgery, loss, and damage of physical certificates
Allow for immediate transfers of securities
Offer the most accurate form of record keeping 



Although brokers presently subsidize their services with material revenues from securities lending, which are gneerally not shared or not materially shared with investors
Risk of decrease of securities lending revenue should the Commission take increased action in decreasing FTDs
Would decrease the ability of certain market participants to lend out securities not actually held on deposit[^1]

[^1]: Cite the case of the people that had the “generate secuirtes” button. Other studies where they charge fees without actually locating the securities for borrow per page 32 at www.sec.gov/comments/s7-32-10/s73210-20109778-264121.pdf

To explain how we presently envision the role of TAD3 in the context of a global capital market, per Section III of PREV, we respectfully submit to the Commission another parallell. Although this reprersentative infrastructure comparison involves illicit activities, we respectfully submit to the Commission that it may exemplify the role of distributed systems in “Web 3.” Alongside this analogy, we respectfully submit to the Commission that, in accordance with note XXXX (US PATENT REVIEW NOT) in PREV, we take money laundering and terrorist financing seriously throughout the design, implimentation, and expansion of TAD3, as further evidenced by our publilc-facing user policies, agreements, and practices avaliable for review on our website.
Tornado Cash was XYZ... Introduce lawsuits and such for frontend operators.
Syndicate SRO members participants are like frontends operators for Tornado Cash. Authenticated users can trade on the go directly with other investors by means of atomic swaps through BlockTrans Syndicate’s investor app. However, as noted in Sectoion III.2.a (???) of PREV, there are certain activites which under the present regulatory regime require the use of a custodian of sorts since transfer agents cannot current perform transactions on behalf of investors, by our present understanding of staff transfer agent guidance, regulations, and non-action letters. An example of such a transaction is performing a dividend reinvestment purchase.[^1]

[^1]: There may be benefits to investors, market efficiency, and capital formation should an exemption for this routine activity be written into SEC rules. While there are stringent order execution rules for a brokers, we respectfully submit to the Commission that a reasonable set of rules for transfer agents to aquire securities in connection with such a routine pre-planned  (PICK A BETTER WORD FOR THAT) transaction may increase the ease by which issuers raise capital through shelf registrations, the rate at which investors compound their retirement savings, and the adoption of self-directed investing, as less repetative manual tasks may increase the ease by wihch users participate on our most developed, andvanced, and liquid capital market.
**_[[←]] Maybe other examples_**



Maybe have a footnote around the Tornado cash info 
Extend to modifying (respectfully suggest etc) Rule 10b–18 to allow issuers to purchase securities from private investors, without going through a single broker dealer per day, so long as the price is at the current secondary market last trading price. Could be some kind of like variation implications. Main point is talking about reducing risking volatility, since you could do that through a single block transaction, without the costs undue burden of brokerage connections - - - on the assumption that the seller of such securities quote ( or sellers ) is neither solicited by the issuer nor its agents
Accordingly, broker-dealers regulated by the Commission as such may become members of the Syndicate SRO so as to effectuate transactions on the books of issuers, rather than through the costly DTCC system.

DTCC’s Unexpected Path to Monopoly by Dan Awrey and Joshua Macey at Cornell Law School.
[[water street comment from there, bailout info from occ sro]]

Although the DTCC moved most to New Jersey last year, the poiint stands that effectively all our present market challenges stem from the DTCC. Unfortunately, due to antiquated DTCC systems and the centralized custodiashgip its operational policies enable, we now face an exocential crisis of innacurate accouintiong throughout the market. These flaws generally propogate at the expense of everyday investors and to the benefit of big banks, brokers, and custodians. 
	We can point fingers all day about how we got to this point over the past number of decades. But the crux of the matter is that, one way or another, there are presently more shares held by investors than ever issued by underlying companies in a number of cases. We will defer citations for this claim to the WhyDRS.org Information Packet previously communicated to Commissioner Gary Genslar, as we believe the diligent, educated, and prudent staff are materially famiar with the widespread continued precedence of failures to deliver enabled by the DTCC despite Regulation SHO.
	We respectfully submit to the Commission that the DTCC; owned communaly by banks, brokers, and certain private interests; maintains material conflicts of interest with investors and issues, promoting and sustaining an overly-intermediated system of securities ownership, trading, and communications.
In this comment and overall agenda regime, we focus on the clear problems of proxy plumbing, , and failures to deliver. We respectfully submit to the COmmission a number of solutions comprehensively solving these predicaments through the Direct Registration System.

WHY TRANSFER AGENT DEPOSITORY BETTER
We understand that the Commission has been contemplating mateiral amendments to transfer agent regulation for a number of years. However, commentors have rightyfully raised the issue that a number of smaller transfer agents serving the needs of small businesses may well be pushed out of the market should their compliance costs increase. Over the past few decadeds, these commentors have rightfully pointed out that, when it comes to modifying transfer agent regulation, the Commission must consider the increased risk to investors should an issuer not be able to afford a transfer agent.

Very rresptcfully ask the Commsission to ADD TRANSFER AGENT TO SRO OPTIONS and explain as per present innovation and the space and due to the number of industry-specefic needs for internal rules. Moreover, our decreased cost of operations due to DLT allows us to continue servicing small businesses even if they fail to make regualr service payments, as has been the case with our first client. Per PREV n.6

We repsectfully submit to the Commission that our continued servicing of these presently XXXXXX investors represents a material benefit to our securities market and the growing number of American small businesses at large. IDK MORE STUFF HERE. Thus, we respectfully submit to the Commsission that it may best protect investors; promote fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and faciliate small business capital formation should staff elect to allow for transfer agent SROs in the case of transfer agent depositories in accordance with note XXXX in PREV.


TAD3 Ecosystem Self Regulation
Should the Commission deem it to be in the best interest of international investors, regulatorsd, and issuers, we would like to respectfully submit the following guidelines for a BlockTrans Syndicate SRO.
We submit that TAD3 may be best understood through a prarallel with Indian securities markets, which have more recently evolved without the undue infliencce of central counterparty clearing houses. We respectfully submit to the Commission that TAD3 is like the demat system. In case staff are not familiar, here is a brief overview of demat, developed by the Indian government:



dematerialization, and is the process of converting physical certificates into electronic form. Demat accounts are digital vaults for stock investments, and are used to store shares, exchange-traded funds, bonds, and mutual funds.

### DTCC Introductino Framing

We apreciate that the majority of modern securities markets employ CCP regims.[^1]

[^1]:  As define in note XYZ of PREV. See also notable altenratives infra Section III.A.

Further, we understand the Commission’s aprehension towards such structes, per the recent forced monopolization of Treasury securities clearing and settlemnt
Dive deep into that
Emmerge with the dissenting opion quote



However, CCPs only emerged in the 19th century because of fundmanetal challenges in debit-ased securities transfers. Namely, such middlemen would not be necessary if it weren’t for the countrerparty risk introduced by early market structures, which are prevalent today.[^1]

###  Primitived Loss SOcializatgion Mechanism thoughts

This or a direct bailout backstop onto SPIC etc, but not equitable or likely due to recet FULL SVB bailout

FTDs as zero sum - “fraud leaves a trail; and its purpose is revealed in the other book because the value taken from that book must also have come from somewhere.” from https://iang.org/papers/triple_entry.html 

But extyaposted in rehypothecation

if the exchange ends up with a position that has an unrealised loss greater than its insurance fund, then the exchange is effectively bankrupt. At that point, it needs to find a way to cover this loss. One option is for the exchange to add more money to the insurance fund. In theory this is fine, but obviously it has its limitations and if the loss is too large, then it may not even be possible.
The other option, is to use the fact that all the money in the system is zero-sum and therefore the profit from the loss that the exchange holds is still “in” the system. After all, someone else (or multiple people) must be holding a same sized profit from the exchange’s loss.
