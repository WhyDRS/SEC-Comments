I really don’t see a need to formally acknowledge this because it is a complete joke. That said, I think the competition arguments are apparent, and we can clearly infer the proprietary nature of much of it. The issue stems from the organizational setup: everything in terms of the study was conducted with no notice to the Commission or industry. That’s a larger issue that ties into the whole open-source operations argument (so tackle in a separate location).

this'll need a senternce of deferfence to "The Commission’s decision to exercise its discretion and dismiss this pending enforcement action rests on its judgment that the dismissal will facilitate the Commission’s ongoing efforts to reform and renew its regulatory approach to the crypto industry, not on any assessment of the merits of the claims alleged in the action." at https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025-47
