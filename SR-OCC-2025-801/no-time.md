- Less reuglation and standalone while "considering any negative procyclical effects and impacts to the stability of the broader financial system." Implies if anybody stopped the music then they would figure it all out. At 2.
- States that RWP insovlencey and defualt testing can "involve confidential and highly sensitive information that could make inclusion of clearing members and other stakeholders inappropriate." suggests the process (i) can be games or (ii) exists only in human heads. I lean towards latter. At 4.

# Fn! Commissioner Gensler moinoply privatization reform note

Robert A. F. Reisner

"Reisner drew up a privatization plan referred to as ‚Äúthe endgame strategy.‚Äù Reisner began talking to Gary Gensler, the Treasury Department's undersecretary for domestic finance, about how it might work. In 2000, Henderson and Reisner met with Elaine Kamarck, a senior staff member in the Clinton administration. Kamarck listened as Reisner talked about the USPS's challenges and raised the possibility of privatization. Then she reminded them that Vice President Al Gore was running for president. ‚ÄúWell, we would have to ask our union friends,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou know, they are critical to the upcoming campaign.‚Äù Soon after, Gensler called Reisner and told him there would be no more discussions about privatization. ‚ÄúWe're putting this on the back burner,‚Äù Gensler said.

It was always clear to Henderson that the postal workers' union had more political influence with the Clinton White House than he did."

Simply changing how shares are held from beneficially owned to directly registered automatically increases how much of the Company you own.  This is true for any Company where shareholders may suspect the DTC has more shares on their books than they should.  Any shareholder that suspects naked shorting is an issue (e.g., üéÆ) would be similarly incentivized to own a bigger portion of the Company by simply Direct Registering Shares.  

Except the DTC hasn't been telling people how many beneficial interests are out there. So it's actually worse than that for Beneficial Shareholders... the SEC says that each participant or pledgee (i.e., beneficial shareholder) having an interest in securities credited to their account has a pro rata interest in the securities of that issue held by the DTC. All the beneficially owned shares held by beneficial shareholders split the pie held by the DTC.

# FN Highlights the paramount importance of maintaining confidence in our financial systems and the United States dollar

TBD, but the easiest hook point will probably be its universal basis of quantification; try to customize with any crypto securities team quotes given time.

It might be close, but I know this will sink the hook in well.

Then let's extrapolate this into making the SRO clearing numbers transparent so that everyone can see the baseline market data on top of the limited existing FTD and SIP disclosures. This draws along the parallel of seeing the flooring light past Moozooz's obstruction without touching the existing gated systems. So, to add to the three negotiating fronts, we can introduce circular data access‚Äîa natural aspect of the TAD system‚Äîgiven that investors would require access to the same ownership information collaboratively shared between agents in a cooperative system.

Please wrap it up with something a little more inspirational from the depths of an equality standpoint. Everything here started around a radical change in social monetary and financial system organization with Nixon's depegging, and I want so dearly to convey that sentiment in saving securities themselves from the same fate. üíú








# FN Good quotes from Crypto 2.0 leaders

On the central clearing of Treasuries in 2023, Pierce writes:

> Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke explained that: "[T]he historical record shows that clearinghouse arrangements have generally withstood even severe crises. This solid performance reflects good planning and sound institutional structures but also some degree of good luck, as crises have also revealed important vulnerabilities, vulnerabilities which prompted subsequent reforms by both the private and public sectors." Good luck is not a strategy, so why can I be confident that Treasury clearinghouses will perform even in times of market stress?

# FN WF DTC Interactions on a More Institutionalized Side (Notes)

Presumes a transitory framing of collaborating with brokers by positioning as replacing the DTCC and empowering them with a more efficient clearing and settlement system.

## Dad Call (try for a single one upo to 4)¬ß

- Received a legal document from WF authorizing signatures with wet signatures.
- Did not require medallions or ID certifications.¬∂
- As commonplace in past chats, they rely on obtaining a "[legal] opinion from a big law firm, and if something goes wrong, they just sue the big law firm."

Emailed DTC only.
Did not conduct a call for that offering.
(Implications of past TA email fraud on a $9M wire item.)

Bank DWAC'd it out and can DWAC back to own custody via physical certificate.

#### S7-25-20 n.20 in the Coinbase chat, (expanded) as a [fn]

This whole point is covered well enough by XX Facts ¬ß II.[^cb-suit]

[^cb-suit]: _See_ _supra_ note {{CB-main at 19}} stating, "Coinbase has earned billions of dollars in revenues by, among other things, collecting transaction fees from investors whom Coinbase has deprived of the disclosures and protections that registration entails and thus exposed to significant risk" in general. Extrapolates to the API and broker considerations at 23 and _priori_.

Man, that is a good source.

Per their trading API at https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/get-started/docs/overview

Parallels the securities interfaces we see from SIP providers as interfaced middlemen.

_Compare_ with the banking approach of never having any kind of public tech by nature of private and proprietary system competition.

Original CB image says "maximize your trading with Coinbase advanced API."

Make an API key "to connect, build, and trade."

The "intermediation failure" part can be laid out without explicit DTCC reference through the other institutions. It will just need to lightly implicate that this is all based on the links commonly underlying the whole framework.

The one item I'd like to add in a footnote here or in the 144 no-action:

[^slowing]

Recently, my partner hit a cat on her drive home from work. Reflecting on the moment, she remarked that she "knew she was supposed to brake" but was in a late-night panic after a hard day. On approach, she swerved to avoid the cat, but unfortunately, it ran in the direction she swerved.


Segway to "Just washed my car."

There was a small mud spot on the tire, but I didn't have a tire cleaning product. Once I finished, I drove it into the garage and tried to clean it. Even though there was only one dirty area, I had to wipe down the whole tire because it was too dark to see the blemish.

And then, simply to **compare** the fragility of these institutions with the decentralized, scalable, global ledger technology existing on blockchain.

As for the slowdown arguments in _supra_ note {{[^slowing]}}, we could start with a reference to 279 with how they themselves have proposed these things. Alternatively:

Chat on how I came into markets and industry and sector and all that last year through two major investor-focused reform efforts aimed at promoting the stability (transparency, and inclusivity) of our financial system.

How Wall St has again and again tried to isolate themselves from idiosyncratic risks and force Main St into potential bankruptcy and such through the liquidation stack, which directly ties into the blatant protection under UCC.

Might we consider ‚Äúhitting the brakes‚Äù on the markets while we publicly review the full extent of ownership diffusion across the industry?

Might this approach allow us to uncover the best course of action if an extensive external audit reveals a material commandeering of American investor assets?

Firstly, we can cite these MF's absolute nothingball of deception:
: _See_ https://wooten.link/ULC-fraud


which starts off with:

> UCC Article 8 gives priority to those lenders who extend secured credit to the clearing corporation to provide the liquidity that might be needed to settle a given day's trades if one of the brokers or banks fails to perform its obligations to deliver securities sold or make payment for securities purchased.

at 2


and then it's a radical extrapolation to FTDs from the FOIA data request debunk.

Individual margin was already growing rapidly, and

These shouldn't need to be directly quoted.


> UCC ¬ß¬ß 8-503 and 8-511. 

> 8-503 mentions the 2 exceptions giving certain secured creditors priority over entitlement holders in 8-511 ~~~~so we strike that reference to 8-511.~~

8-503(a): "except as otherwise provided in Section 8-511"

> in 8-511 we strike the 2 exceptions (b) and (c).

in re question
> Where securities are held in pooled form (e.g. a collective securities position, rather than segregated individual positions per person), does the investor have rights attaching to particular securities in the pool?
they write:
> No. The security entitlement holder does not have rights attaching to particular securities in the pool, he has a _pro rata_ share of the interests in the financial asset held by its securities intermediary to the amount needed to satisfy the aggregate claims of the entitlement holders in that issue. This is true even if investor positions are "segregated."

The other quotes get into control and specifically "an investor is always vulnerable to a securities intermediary that does not itself have interests in a financial asset sufficient to cover all of the securities entitlements that it has created in that financial asset" but then you're diving into the two exceptions tacked by the "margin" [feDreply at n.15.](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/1ee786fb-3c78-4903-9701-d614892d09d6/taking-feb24-screen2.pdf#page=45)

#### Central DTCC DA study cited later, requisitioning control over the entire industry by a single corporation that exists with for-profit stakeholders, either directly or indirectly.
In the former case, we have a public corporation that outed in their S-1 filing (no citation) that they will "[insert quote on saving the world crap]... [insert very compelling different quote about making one billion monies]."

I don't think we touched on this yet.
Perhaps implicate it lightly with identification and name-dropping of the select few worst offenders thereto.




### Bank Transfers

Initiated Dec 18, 2024, from CB.
To WF due to no support for LR via either manual or Plaid as the only option.
Estimated standard 2-day transfer.

On Dec 20, 2024, WF performed an RTP instant transfer to LR.
Placed on hold until Dec 27, 2024.

Received at least three calls from LR and a compliance email mandating a call by Dec 26, 2024, at 3 PM ET:
"Please give us a call today 12/26 before 3 PM EST," stated in virtual 'secure' webmail at 10:49 AM ET.
"We are reaching out to ask for your help verifying some information."
