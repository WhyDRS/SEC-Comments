- Less reuglation and standalone while "considering any negative procyclical effects and impacts to the stability of the broader financial system." Implies if anybody stopped the music then they would figure it all out. At 2.
- States that RWP insovlencey and defualt testing can "involve confidential and highly sensitive information that could make inclusion of clearing members and other stakeholders inappropriate." suggests the process (i) can be games or (ii) exists only in human heads. I lean towards latter. At 4.
- Asks not to notify the Commission when considerign insolvency and faiure of the financial system at 5.

# Fn! Commissioner Gensler moinoply privatization reform note

Robert A. F. Reisner

"Reisner drew up a privatization plan referred to as ‚Äúthe endgame strategy.‚Äù Reisner began talking to Gary Gensler, the Treasury Department's undersecretary for domestic finance, about how it might work. In 2000, Henderson and Reisner met with Elaine Kamarck, a senior staff member in the Clinton administration. Kamarck listened as Reisner talked about the USPS's challenges and raised the possibility of privatization. Then she reminded them that Vice President Al Gore was running for president. ‚ÄúWell, we would have to ask our union friends,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou know, they are critical to the upcoming campaign.‚Äù Soon after, Gensler called Reisner and told him there would be no more discussions about privatization. ‚ÄúWe're putting this on the back burner,‚Äù Gensler said.

It was always clear to Henderson that the postal workers' union had more political influence with the Clinton White House than he did."

Simply changing how shares are held from beneficially owned to directly registered automatically increases how much of the Company you own.  This is true for any Company where shareholders may suspect the DTC has more shares on their books than they should.  Any shareholder that suspects naked shorting is an issue (e.g., üéÆ) would be similarly incentivized to own a bigger portion of the Company by simply Direct Registering Shares.  

Except the DTC hasn't been telling people how many beneficial interests are out there. So it's actually worse than that for Beneficial Shareholders... the SEC says that each participant or pledgee (i.e., beneficial shareholder) having an interest in securities credited to their account has a pro rata interest in the securities of that issue held by the DTC. All the beneficially owned shares held by beneficial shareholders split the pie held by the DTC.

# FN Highlights the paramount importance of maintaining confidence in our financial systems and the United States dollar

TBD, but the easiest hook point will probably be its universal basis of quantification; try to customize with any crypto securities team quotes given time.

It might be close, but I know this will sink the hook in well.

Then let's extrapolate this into making the SRO clearing numbers transparent so that everyone can see the baseline market data on top of the limited existing FTD and SIP disclosures. This draws along the parallel of seeing the flooring light past Moozooz's obstruction without touching the existing gated systems. So, to add to the three negotiating fronts, we can introduce circular data access‚Äîa natural aspect of the TAD system‚Äîgiven that investors would require access to the same ownership information collaboratively shared between agents in a cooperative system.

Please wrap it up with something a little more inspirational from the depths of an equality standpoint. Everything here started around a radical change in social monetary and financial system organization with Nixon's depegging, and I want so dearly to convey that sentiment in saving securities themselves from the same fate. üíú








# FN Good quotes from Crypto 2.0 leaders

On the central clearing of Treasuries in 2023, Pierce writes:

> Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke explained that: "[T]he historical record shows that clearinghouse arrangements have generally withstood even severe crises. This solid performance reflects good planning and sound institutional structures but also some degree of good luck, as crises have also revealed important vulnerabilities, vulnerabilities which prompted subsequent reforms by both the private and public sectors." Good luck is not a strategy, so why can I be confident that Treasury clearinghouses will perform even in times of market stress?

Presumes a transitory framing of collaborating with brokers by positioning as replacing the DTCC and empowering them with a more efficient clearing and settlement system.

## Dad Call (try for a single one upo to 4)¬ß

- Received a legal document from WF authorizing signatures with wet signatures.
- Did not require medallions or ID certifications.¬∂
- As commonplace in past chats, they rely on obtaining a "[legal] opinion from a big law firm, and if something goes wrong, they just sue the big law firm."

Emailed DTC only.
Did not conduct a call for that offering.
(Implications of past TA email fraud on a $9M wire item.)

Bank DWAC'd it out and can DWAC back to own custody via physical certificate.

#### S7-25-20 n.20 in the Coinbase chat, (expanded) as a [fn]

This whole point is covered well enough by XX Facts ¬ß II.[^cb-suit]

[^cb-suit]: _See_ _supra_ note {{CB-main at 19}} stating, "Coinbase has earned billions of dollars in revenues by, among other things, collecting transaction fees from investors whom Coinbase has deprived of the disclosures and protections that registration entails and thus exposed to significant risk" in general. Extrapolates to the API and broker considerations at 23 and _priori_.

Man, that is a good source.

Per their trading API at https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/get-started/docs/overview

Parallels the securities interfaces we see from SIP providers as interfaced middlemen.

_Compare_ with the banking approach of never having any kind of public tech by nature of private and proprietary system competition.

Original CB image says "maximize your trading with Coinbase advanced API."

Make an API key "to connect, build, and trade."

Recently, my partner hit a cat on her drive home from work. Reflecting on the moment, she remarked that she "knew she was supposed to brake" but was in a late-night panic after a hard day. On approach, she swerved to avoid the cat, but unfortunately, it ran in the direction she swerved.


Segway to "Just washed my car."

There was a small mud spot on the tire, but I didn't have a tire cleaning product. Once I finished, I drove it into the garage and tried to clean it. Even though there was only one dirty area, I had to wipe down the whole tire because it was too dark to see the blemish.

Around the time Coinbase decided to close down its longstanding nonprofit initiative, I helped my partner open a Coinbase account so that she could deposit U.S. dollars onto the Stellar network. The purpose of these funds was to invest in an asset tradable on a decentralized exchange. When opening the account, we answered all questions indicating such intentions, provided all requested PII, and linked her bank account.

Within a few months, it was time to acquire the asset I wanted my partner to invest in. The price was ready to break out, so we started depositing funds into the account. Over the course of at least three months, my partner deposited her savings with Coinbase to acquire USD Coin ("USDC") and subsequently withdraw those tokens onto her blockchain wallet, as established offline and initialized through a hardware security device. These funds originated in part from her full-time employment and in part from a parental graduation gift upon her completion of college last year.

At least three initial deposits from Coinbase into my partner's wallet went fine, and she slowly accumulated the target asset. At no point did my partner send any assets to other wallets through a direct transfer. Moreover, she never interacted with any smart contracts that could implicate "impermissible activities." It was a very simple distributed-ledger account that received funds and used them to acquire assets.

Then, my partner received a bonus from work roughly equivalent to half her portfolio. Thereafter, she deposited a majority of the funds into Coinbase, where we expected to wait a couple of days for the transfer to clear.[^banking-BS] On 14 Oct 2024, she received this email, given with original emphasis:

> Coinbase takes several steps to keep your account safe, and we actively monitor for unusual activity and scams that may affect our customers. **Based on this monitoring, we are concerned you may have sent, or are trying to send, crypto to a fraudulent person or platform.** Out of an abundance of caution and to protect you against potential losses, we have temporarily **limited your ability to send additional crypto until November 14, 2024.** This restriction will be removed automatically after the set time period elapses.

This was extremely concerning given my past experiences trading financial assets. I began acquiring this particular asset for my partner months prior because I knew it would materially increase in value. Indeed, in a transaction four days before this communication, I invested the last of my USDC savings into this asset given its technical breakout setup.[^john-acquisition]

My partner had been asked to submit facial scans and identification documents to Coinbase before, so we were surprised by the recurrent request to complete a "government check" of her physical credentials. We completed this document submission and liveness ascertainment at least three times so as to satisfy Coinbase. We received an affirmative acceptance by an automated system, but the Coinbase interface still said my partner could not transfer her USDC for an entire month "as a precautionary measure, to protect you against potential loss."

In the interim waiting period, Coinbase maintained my partner's ability to buy the target asset through their centralized exchange interface. However, the only available trading option required at least a 1% commission on top of a three-figure trading fee. Comparatively, the free decentralized exchange on the network offers the same service without the risk of front-running.[^Garand-story] Accordingly, and in the capitalist principle of not supporting businesses which I despise, I refuse to trade on a centralized exchange what can otherwise be transacted on a decentralized exchange.[^cex-dex]

Over a week later on the 23rd, my partner received an email declaring that Coinbase had "completed your account review, and buy/send/deposit services remain disabled at this time." When logging into the Coinbase website, she was greeted with a new message stating her account could no longer send any assets at any time as "a precautionary measure, to protect you against potential loss." Since this was worded similarly to the last message, I assumed she could transfer them later, such as the original November date given such comprehensive disclosure of personal information.

At the time, my partner had no other option to deposit funds into her wallet in a timely manner. Indeed, transferring back to her bank account would take days before another days-long wait to any alternatives, which then imposed their own holding-period transfer restrictions. Thus, she was stuck with the funds sitting in her account, unable to send them anywhere they could be bridged over to the decentralized exchange. Does the Commission tolerate this lethargic processing of customer deposits?[^debank]

Upon checking back on the account on the original release date three weeks later, I found the same message that all transfers were disallowed. This was quite frustrating because the price of the target asset had increased by more than 30% while we waited for the deposit to process. Notwithstanding, I meticulously checked the account each day thereafter, until a new message appeared over two weeks later on the 29th:

> We are reviewing your account. This process can take up to 3 days.

At this point, the value of the target asset had increased by a factor of six. This was materially concerning because the profit on that trade would have been approximately twice my partner's pre-tax annual income. In the next three days, the target asset continued to appreciate while Coinbase reviewed her account.


[^banking-BS]: As staff know, the American banking system often takes multiple days to transfer funds between accounts. Unfortunate as this is, Coinbase worsens the process for acquisitions of USDC by traditionally disallowing blockchain transfers for at least a week after this period. Accordingly, any transaction intent on blockchain asset acquisitions from a bank account forces users to gamble that the price won't materially increase during the extensive waiting period.

Accounts can swap between any blockchain-network assets with a permissionless order book which employs zero intermediaries, as can be seen in an example between two completely arbitrary user-defined tokens, _available at_ https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/tx/2acf44db14c9263b6f7573cd997b8e065c3c9222a85dd26ad8da4940dd2df31e.

[^Garand-story]: _See_ note 7 of a technical development discussion detailing the common practices of proprietary traders to arbitrage between centralized cryptocurrency exchanges through power and latency analysis, _available at_ https://wooten.link/1558. Given the nonexistence of a NMS for cryptocurrencies and a generally international market for their central exchange, does the Commission believe staff can efficiently oversee all forthcoming trading and registration supervision? Or would staff prefer an updated system based on the decentralized governance ethos commonly underlying these common endeavors which are so often paired with decentralized exchanges?

[^cex-dex]: Namely, all mainstream instances of the former type operate solely on a profit-driven proprietary business model. Often these entities fundraise from the investing public in an effort to sustain their enterprise, which exists exclusively due to fees later charged for trading services. I find this particularly concerning because exchanges and liquidity have a well-known "lock-in" effect whereby the network effect of bids and offers accrues exclusively to the provider of an exchange venue. As staff know, Wall Street perpetually uses this value for bribing introducing brokers for order flow, which hinders price discovery through met supply and demand.

[^debank]: _See also_ Congressional industry sentiment impeding technological growth in our great Nation by revoking access to the legacy interbank payment and account network, _available at_ https://youtu.be/WgjUM8U81FY?t=4639. Might distributed ledger technologies and decentralized governance offer a resilient and transparent record of investor assets? Could they at least challenge the "brick wall" of opacity and nonresponsive support options present at central intermediaries like Coinbase?
