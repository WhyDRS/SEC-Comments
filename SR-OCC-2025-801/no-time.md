- Less reuglation and standalone while "considering any negative procyclical effects and impacts to the stability of the broader financial system." Implies if anybody stopped the music then they would figure it all out. At 2.
- States that RWP insovlencey and defualt testing can "involve confidential and highly sensitive information that could make inclusion of clearing members and other stakeholders inappropriate." suggests the process (i) can be games or (ii) exists only in human heads. I lean towards latter. At 4.

# Fn! Commissioner Gensler moinoply privatization reform note

Robert A. F. Reisner

"Reisner drew up a privatization plan referred to as ‚Äúthe endgame strategy.‚Äù Reisner began talking to Gary Gensler, the Treasury Department's undersecretary for domestic finance, about how it might work. In 2000, Henderson and Reisner met with Elaine Kamarck, a senior staff member in the Clinton administration. Kamarck listened as Reisner talked about the USPS's challenges and raised the possibility of privatization. Then she reminded them that Vice President Al Gore was running for president. ‚ÄúWell, we would have to ask our union friends,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou know, they are critical to the upcoming campaign.‚Äù Soon after, Gensler called Reisner and told him there would be no more discussions about privatization. ‚ÄúWe're putting this on the back burner,‚Äù Gensler said.

It was always clear to Henderson that the postal workers' union had more political influence with the Clinton White House than he did."

Simply changing how shares are held from beneficially owned to directly registered automatically increases how much of the Company you own.  This is true for any Company where shareholders may suspect the DTC has more shares on their books than they should.  Any shareholder that suspects naked shorting is an issue (e.g., üéÆ) would be similarly incentivized to own a bigger portion of the Company by simply Direct Registering Shares.  

Except the DTC hasn't been telling people how many beneficial interests are out there. So it's actually worse than that for Beneficial Shareholders... the SEC says that each participant or pledgee (i.e., beneficial shareholder) having an interest in securities credited to their account has a pro rata interest in the securities of that issue held by the DTC. All the beneficially owned shares held by beneficial shareholders split the pie held by the DTC.

# FN Highlights the paramount importance of maintaining confidence in our financial systems and the United States dollar

TBD, but the easiest hook point will probably be its universal basis of quantification; try to customize with any crypto securities team quotes given time.

It might be close, but I know this will sink the hook in well.

Then let's extrapolate this into making the SRO clearing numbers transparent so that everyone can see the baseline market data on top of the limited existing FTD and SIP disclosures. This draws along the parallel of seeing the flooring light past Moozooz's obstruction without touching the existing gated systems. So, to add to the three negotiating fronts, we can introduce circular data access‚Äîa natural aspect of the TAD system‚Äîgiven that investors would require access to the same ownership information collaboratively shared between agents in a cooperative system.

Please wrap it up with something a little more inspirational from the depths of an equality standpoint. Everything here started around a radical change in social monetary and financial system organization with Nixon's depegging, and I want so dearly to convey that sentiment in saving securities themselves from the same fate. üíú








# FN Good quotes from Crypto 2.0 leaders

On the central clearing of Treasuries in 2023, Pierce writes:

> Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke explained that: "[T]he historical record shows that clearinghouse arrangements have generally withstood even severe crises. This solid performance reflects good planning and sound institutional structures but also some degree of good luck, as crises have also revealed important vulnerabilities, vulnerabilities which prompted subsequent reforms by both the private and public sectors." Good luck is not a strategy, so why can I be confident that Treasury clearinghouses will perform even in times of market stress?

# FN WF DTC Interactions on a More Institutionalized Side (Notes)

Presumes a transitory framing of collaborating with brokers by positioning as replacing the DTCC and empowering them with a more efficient clearing and settlement system.

## Dad Call (try for a single one upo to 4)¬ß

- Received a legal document from WF authorizing signatures with wet signatures.
- Did not require medallions or ID certifications.¬∂
- As commonplace in past chats, they rely on obtaining a "[legal] opinion from a big law firm, and if something goes wrong, they just sue the big law firm."

Emailed DTC only.
Did not conduct a call for that offering.
(Implications of past TA email fraud on a $9M wire item.)

Bank DWAC'd it out and can DWAC back to own custody via physical certificate.

#### S7-25-20 n.20 in the Coinbase chat, (expanded) as a [fn]

This whole point is covered well enough by XX Facts ¬ß II.[^cb-suit]

[^cb-suit]: _See_ _supra_ note {{CB-main at 19}} stating, "Coinbase has earned billions of dollars in revenues by, among other things, collecting transaction fees from investors whom Coinbase has deprived of the disclosures and protections that registration entails and thus exposed to significant risk" in general. Extrapolates to the API and broker considerations at 23 and _priori_.

Man, that is a good source.

Per their trading API at https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/get-started/docs/overview

Parallels the securities interfaces we see from SIP providers as interfaced middlemen.

_Compare_ with the banking approach of never having any kind of public tech by nature of private and proprietary system competition.

Original CB image says "maximize your trading with Coinbase advanced API."

Make an API key "to connect, build, and trade."
