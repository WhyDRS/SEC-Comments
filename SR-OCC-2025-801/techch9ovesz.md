# Chives' thoughts on DTC DA tudy (as previously written)



#### Chives' thoughts

--will need to reformat section into direct response to the DTCC blockchain study which has been mentioned a few times already--

The diagram on 112 is simple and fantastic, in my opinion. It doesn't cover custody, but it doesn't need to be appreciated—types of assets and implied claims therein.

I also think the tokenization explainers on 113 are fantastic. "Tokenization has the potential to unlock the benefits of programmable, interoperable ledgers to a wider array of legacy financial assets," with a graphic to the right establishing where relevant data is stored (ideally, a public read blockchain, but similar to DTCC, this is unspecified). **SIDEBAR** - WhyDRS could use articles breaking down tokenization in a similar way but from a custodial perspective, relating it to a title deed in a safe if holding the private key.

"The benefits of tokenization extend far beyond and are independent of native crypto assets like Bitcoin, as well as the public, permissionless blockchain technology those assets have popularized" - (114) Spoke too soon. Giving away the game here, aren't they? --> Leads into the unified ledger section you highlighted --> Must "be developed under the auspices of central banks."

"Cybersecurity Threats: Certain types of DLT solutions (public, permissionless blockchains) are vulnerable to hacking and other cybersecurity attacks, which could pose risks to the security of tokenized Treasuries" - (118) Maybe in the case specifically of a Treasury issued by a nation-state, I could appreciate the point here. Typically, public permissionless is my preference.

Under concerns, they include:
Increased Complexity and Opacity:
− Tokenization leads to more composability, which could significantly add complexity and opacity to the financial system from new and non-traditional assets being added to the digital financial ecosystem.
− Improperly coded smart contracts can rapidly trigger unwanted financial transactions with unintended consequences.

Page 120 is borrowed from https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/DASCPWhitePaper.pdf, which I don't think I'd read before—some new homework.
