While apes have grouped up [previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/wd0iw4/halp_kneed_moar_comments_srocc2022803/) to bring attention to problematic policies through mass comments and petitions, few of our dispersed efforts seem to create regulatory wins. Thankfully, brilliant community members have been vehemently writing to the Commission, seeking their points in change that helps all of us. By participating in this repository, you can collaborate with others' ideas, research, and existing work to collectively craft a more substantive perspective which regulators can raise for comprehensive and accurate points.


- The SEC website's comment page can take some material time to add your thoughts.  
  - Make sure to prepare the subject line and destination in accordance with the pending rules.  
- The website will display the name signed in the actual comment itself, regardless of the submission email.  
- The date on the list item is the date the SEC receives the comment in Eastern Time, regardless of business hours.  
  - They will accept and date comments sent over weekends or holidays, but again, it can take some time to post online.  
- For some reason, the PDF encoding used after submission often invalidates text hyperlinks, so it's safest to use full URLs.
