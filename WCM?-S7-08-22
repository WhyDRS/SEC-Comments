​Dear Ms. Countryman and others this may concern at the SEC,

As a retail investor, I respectfully submit this petition and comment letter regarding the recent Order Granting Temporary Exemption Pursuant to Section 13(f)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 from Compliance with Rule 13f-2 and Form SHO [[Release No. 34-102380](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/exorders/2025/34-102380.pdf)] (“Order”) signed by Assistant Secretary Sherry R. Haywood dated February 7, 2025.

As a retail investor, I am concerned the SEC may be bureaucratically acquiescing to and prioritizing certain institutional interests over potential systemic risks posed by short selling.  The Order states that “[t]hrough telephonic meetings and letters, certain institutional investment managers that may meet the reporting thresholds specified in Rule 13f-2 have stated that they need additional time to implement Form SHO reporting”[Order at pgs 1-2] with footnote 4 identifying letters from the Financial Information Forum (“FIF”), Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (“SIFMA”), SIFMA’s Asset Management Group, Investment Company Institute (“ICI”), Insured Retirement Institute, FIA Principal Traders Group (“FIA PTG”), Investment Adviser Association (“IAA”), Managed Funds Association (“MFA”), and Alternative Investment Management Association (“AIMA”).

Many of these identified institutional interests were recognized by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") as opposing adoption during the comment period for this Rule 13f-2 and Related Form SHO [see, e.g., Release No. 34-98738; File No. S7-08-22 which stated "[t]he Commission also received numerous comments that opposed the adoption…" with corresponding footnote 350 identifying SIFMA, AIMA, FIA PTG, and FIF].  ICI stated during the comment period that this rule "is unnecessary and, on balance, overly burdensome" [Release No. 34-98738; File No. S7-08-22 footnote 310].  IAA shared concerns this proposal was overly burdensome [Release No. 34-98738; File No. S7-08-22 at footnote 808].

Concerns raised by these institutional interests were already considered when the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") adopted Rule 13f-2 and CAT amendments to "enhance the Commission’s ability to protect investors and investigate market manipulation by providing a clearer view into the short selling market and improving the Commission's reconstruction of significant market events" with "improved identification of manipulative short selling strategies which may also serve as a deterrent to would-be manipulators and thus may help prevent manipulation" and "improve the Commission's observation of short sale activity that potentially poses a systemic risk". [see, e.g., Release No. 34-98738; File No. S7-08-22 under C.1. Economic Effects - Investor Protection and Market Manipulation]
It’s telling that these institutional interests opposed to this Rule 13f-2 and Related Form SHO need additional time to implement Form SHO reporting [Order pg 2]. Only certain institutional interests opposed to short disclosure reporting need additional time; despite this Rule 13f-2 and related Form SHO having been adopted October 2023 and effective January 2024 with compliance required a year later on January 2, 2025 [Order pg 1].  Perhaps I’m not an expert as a retail investor, but it certainly looks like certain institutional interests opposed to short position and short activity reporting have been dragging their feet for over a year regarding compliance; then asked for (and given) excessive relief to further delay compliance with said short disclosure.

The purported reason for granting a temporary exemption from compliance with Rule 13f-2 and Related Form SHO is "in consideration of publication of the December 16, 2024 Form SHO Documents" [Order pg 4] referring to the Commission’s publication of the web-fillable version of Form SHO and the related Form SHO XML technical specifications and EDGAR Filer Manual updates on December 16, 2024 where the Form SHO XML Technical Specifications are available at https://www.sec.gov/submit-filings/technical-specifications#xml [Order pg 2]  Certain "[i]ndustry participants cited challenges in completing implementation of system builds and testing for Form SHO reporting pending finalization and publication of the Form SHO XML technical specifications, which the Commission published on December 16, 2024" identifying SIFMA and FIF as implementation challenged industry participants [Order pgs 2-3 footnote 9]  However, a nearly identical draft version of the Form SHO XML Technical Specifications was available a month earlier on November 18, 2024 released "to assist filers, filing agents, and software developers in their preparation". [see 2024 Archived XML Technical Specifications at https://www.sec.gov/submit-filings/technical-specifications]  A comparison of the schema files between the draft and final 1.0 versions found no differences.  (Did the implementation challenged industry participants even look at the draft Form SHO XML Technical Specifications? Or did these procrastinators just drag their feet to further delay compliance? As other industry participants have not complained about implementation challenges, it appears only those against short reporting and disclosure are both implementation challenged and adverse to using the web-fillable version of Form SHO.) 

The Commission adopted Rule 13f-2 and Related Form SHO to "improve the Commission's observation of short sale activity that potentially poses a systemic risk". [Release No. 34-98738; File No. S7-08-22 under C.1. Economic Effects - Investor Protection and Market Manipulation]  Specifically, "[h]aving detailed confidential information about which Managers currently hold large positions might also help the Commission observe potential systemic risk concerns regarding short selling" as "[l]arge and concentrated short positions have the potential to increase systemic risk" [Release No. 34-98738; File No. S7-08-22 under C.1. Economic Effects - Investor Protection and Market Manipulation]  "The data to be reported … in Proposed Form SHO will provide regulators with additional context and transparency into how and when reported gross short positions were closed out or increased, which will help the Commission assess systemic risk." [Release No. 34-98738; File No. S7-08-22 under FINAL RULE] In addition, "[t]his reported net activity information will assist the Commission in assessing systemic risk and in reconstructing unusual market events, including instances of extreme volatility" [Release No. 34-98738; File No. S7-08-22 under FINAL RULE] as "the Commission elaborated on the limitations of using existing data, such as the CAT or FINRA data, to reconstruct market events like the "meme" stock events of January 2021" [Release No. 34-98738; File No. S7-08-22 under i. New Reporting Regime—Comments and Final Rule]. Rule 13f-2 and Related Form SHO is for "addressing data limitations exposed by market events, especially the market volatility in January 2021" [Release No. 34-98738; File No. S7-08-22 under VIII.A. Economic Analysis – Introduction] because "CAT does not include data that can be used to track such positions, and as discussed further above, Commission staff experience in reconstructing the events of January 2021 provided insights into the challenges of using existing CAT data for this purpose" [Release No. 34-98738; File No. S7-08-22 under VIII.A. Economic Analysis – Introduction].
Against that background for Rule 13f-2 and Related Form SHO, SEC Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda counterintuitively said "[i]t is important that data collected by the Commission is accurate, complete, and helpful to the market" [SEC Press Release 2025-37] when announcing this exemption. Why is the Commission delaying reporting for Rule 13f-2 and Related Form SHO which addresses limitations of existing data and the absence of data necessary to reconstruct unusual market events such as the events of January 2021? The exemption is particularly confounding as Rule 13f-2 and Related Form SHO would collect "detailed confidential information about which Managers currently hold large positions [that] might also help the Commission observe potential systemic risk concerns regarding short selling" [Release No. 34-98738; File No. S7-08-22 under C.1. Economic Effects - Investor Protection and Market Manipulation] Despite acknowledging "abusive naked short selling as part of a manipulative scheme remains unlawful" [SEC Press Release 2025-37] where this Rule 13f-2 and Related Form SHO would collect relevant data, the Commission is delaying reporting with the empty promise that "the Commission will use its regulatory tools to combat such illegal activity" [SEC Press Release 2025-37]. The Commission admitted it has no regulatory tools to combat such illegal activity and just punted on its tool for doing so!  Perhaps I’m not an expert as a retail investor, but it certainly looks like the Commission is willfully blinding itself from collecting information about which Managers currently hold large short positions to prevent any reconstruction of unusual market events, including instances of extreme volatility. Why?
Why would the Commission now opt to collect no data?  Why would the Commission punt on "improved identification of manipulative short selling strategies which may also serve as a deterrent to would-be manipulators and thus may help prevent manipulation" and "improve the Commission's observation of short sale activity that potentially poses a systemic risk" [see, e.g., Release No. 34-98738; File No. S7-08-22 under C.1. Economic Effects - Investor Protection and Market Manipulation]? Why punt on collecting data that could identify manipulative short selling strategies which could deter would-be manipulators and prevent manipulation??? Why punt on collecting data that could reveal systemic risks???

Naked short selling, particularly abusive and/or predatory naked short selling, is lucrative and manipulative [see, e.g., Release No. 34-98738; File No. S7-08-22 under C.1. Economic Effects - Investor Protection and Market Manipulation regarding illegal short and distort strategies and corresponding footnote 592 citing Bodie Zvi, Alex Kane, and Alan J. Marcus, Investments and Portfolio Management, McGraw Hill Education (2011) and Rafael Matta, Sergio H. Rocha, and Paulo Vaz, Predatory Stock Price Manipulation, available at https://papers.ssrn.com/​sol3/​papers.cfm?​abstract_​id=​3551282] with no regulatory oversight, as admitted by the Commission.  While I’m only a retail investor, there has long been a perception the Commission is in bed with Wall Street.  A perception perhaps best portrayed by the movie Big Short (2015) [IMDB] where Karen Gillan as an SEC staffer leaves a hotel in the morning with a Goldman Sachs employee.  While this concept is more officially recognized as "regulatory capture" [Wikipedia], retail investors around the world are confounded by why the Commission would willfully blind themselves by delaying short sale data reporting [SEC Press Release 2025-37] after acknowledging their existing data is incapable of reconstructing unusual market events, including instances of extreme volatility in January 2021 [Release No. 34-98738; File No. S7-08-22].  Regulatory capture, absent other explanations, is the only plausible explanation; especially when CME Group CEO Terry Duffy said on Fox News "I don’t know where Gary Gensler was, but my regulator at the CFTC I bribed, I asked them: why in the world are you invoking the commodity exchange act Section 5 Paragraph B" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoDL_VFUe68] wherein "the purpose of this chapter [is] to deter and prevent price manipulation or any other disruptions to market integrity; to ensure the financial integrity of all transactions subject to this chapter and the avoidance of systemic risk; to protect all market participants from fraudulent or other abusive sales practices and misuses of customer assets". Are there now stronger connections between the SEC and Wall St after Gary Gensler’s departure?

Data is unequivocally better than no data. Unless, of course, the Commission’s goal here is to 🙈🙉🙊 [See no evil. Hear no evil. Speak no evil.] by remaining willfully blind to protect the Managers currently holding large short positions as the Commission recognizes that "if the Commission had Form SHO data during the meme stock events of January 2021 then it would have had a clearer view as to which Managers held large short positions prior to the volatility event and thus which Managers could have been at greatest risk of suffering significant harm from a short squeeze" [Release No. 34-98738; File No. S7-08-22 under C.1. Economic Effects - Investor Protection and Market Manipulation]. 



_Therefore,_ I petition and request the Commission to:

1) Immediately rescind the Order Granting Temporary Exemption Pursuant to Section 13(f)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 from Compliance with Rule 13f-2 and Form SHO [Release No. 34-102380 (Press Release)].

2) Require Form SHO reporting effective February 2025. Institutional investment managers that meet or exceed a reporting threshold specified under Rule 13f-2 should be required to file the Form SHO report for February 2025 within 14 calendar days after the end of February 2025.

As the original compliance date was January 2, 2025 with initial Form SHO filings for January 2025 originally due by February 14, 2025, this request already represents a one month delay for the opposing institutions who were almost certainly ready to comply and report; but simply didn’t want to.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Retail Investor
